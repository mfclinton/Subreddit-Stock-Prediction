A better definition is that's it's a medium that allows for asynchronous exchanges of products and services. It's value is inherant in what people will exchange for it. Precious metals like gold and silver were at one point a good backing for money because they are limited resources. Like a natural ""fed"" that limits the amount of money in circulation. This feeds the thinking that gold amounts and prices should ultimately drive inflation rates, and that if the dollar inflates beyond the price of gold or the dollar suddenly loses value relative to gold, or the US defaults on it's debt, that (US) money will suddenly drop in value and everyone holding gold will retain their value. In reality, precious metals are no longer needed to limit the amount of money in circulation, and gold is only as valuable as your girlfriend wants to have earrings made from it. Gold commodities have been in a bubble for years and are due to come down. The only demand seems to be political doomsday proponents like your family member and wall street firms playing into the hype.

Here's the deal: due to technology the actual output for working hour has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years, which means that you can leverage on growth easily and that growth does not depend only on natural resources. This quite of a common assumption people make regarding growth, that it only depends on natural resources which is not and more than often they compare the economy game to physics and energy/resources creation. 


*Here’s the logic lapse: energy growth is not the same as economic growth.*  **GDP merely measures what people are willing to pay for, which is not necessarily connected to the use of energy, or any other physical resource**. True, since the beginning of the industrial revolution the two have tended to go hand in hand, but there’s no logical reason why that tendency needs to continue. Indeed, it appears to have stopped already.

Would you like to take a guess at energy growth per person in the United States over the last quarter of a century? [...] Less than zero. I compared 1986 with 2011 and got a rate of minus 0.17 per cent. Economic growth per person in the same period averaged more than 2.5 per cent. **Over twenty-five years, GDP as a whole almost doubled, but energy use rose by less than a quarter**. If I had picked a different time period then I would have got a slightly different number, but the story would have been the same: energy use per person isn’t increasing in the United States. It peaked back in 1978.

We'll spend the next 50 years fighting more and more wars for the last drops of profitable oil, all while sacrificing critical resources that we should be using to diversify our energy generation and transportation needs, and transition our infrastructure off of what's a finite medium.

But because oil, energy, and our economy is focused solely on profit, we will be lead down a path of destruction by the energy companies who want to keep a monopoly on generation, the military industrial complex who just wants to keep being fed, and the false ideas of empire, where in the USA must keep control of everything remaining so that the other nations can't rise up and challenge our already faltering hegemony.    This also will stimy development and investment in infrastructure, because what doesn't immediately return profit, isn't acted on.

t3_1w14rp,cey04nx,"think of a dollar as something that you can buy, like cheese, or a new car.  just some commodity.

all other things being equal, the price you pay for a dollar, in pesos, depends on how many dollars there are, and how many people want them.

if lots of argentinians want dollars then the price of dollars will go up (because there are only so many dollars available).

alternatively, you can say that the value of the peso goes down.  that is the same as saying that the dollar goes up - it just depends on which way you want to look at things.

so the reason that there was ""downward pressure"" on the peso is because argentinians wanted to buy dollars (amongst other things).

but the government can counteract this.  it can give argentinians dollars at a lower price (if it has any).  so, for a long time, the argentine government has been using up its store of dollars, selling them at a low price to argentinians.

by doing this, the government kept the value of the peso high (or kept the value of the dollar low) and so kept inflation under control.

but there comes a point when the government cannot give out more dollars because it has run out.  that is basically what happened yesterday.  at that point argentinians have to start paying the ""real"" price for dollars and the peso drops suddenly (and so inflation rises, because imported things become more expensive).

-------------

ok, so that shows that what governments can do to control inflation and devaluation in the short term is to sell (or buy, depending on the need) dollars in the money markets.

but there is a limit to this.  they don't have an infinite reserve of dollars, so they can't do it forever.  and they hit the limit yesterday[1].

-------------

governments can do other things, of course.  one thing they can do is print more pesos.  but that doesn't help control inflation, it makes it worse.  so they won't do that.  maybe in some way they will try to reduce the amount of pesos in circulation, but i don't know how they can do that.

so argentina is in a mess.  and the government needs to look at the larger picture.  which is that people don't want to invest or pay taxes or generally participate in the legal economy because of corruption and a lack of faith in the politicians.  instead, they want to buy dollars because they don't trust the government with their pesos.  and the politicians can't fix this because they are corrupt politicians in a corrupt country where corruption is pretty much an accepted fact of daily life.

so you are pretty much fucked.  and as someone living in chile i only hope they don't decide a war will help take your mind off things.... (i guess it's more likely they will try to go to war over las malvinas)

--------------------------

in fact, you could argue that where you are is normal: that's what dollars are worth.  and the government needs to admit it can't fix everything.

----------------

[1] they didn't actually run out of dollars, but what is left they need to pay debts.  so another alternative is that they change their mind, and decide to sell those dollars too - perhaps just before calling an election.  that way they ""control"" inflation for a moment, and so get re-elected.  of course, when the dollars do run out, it will be even worse, because they will have to default and external investment will crash.",2,1390596219.0

The problem is that each country involved has a different mechanism by which these crises have come about.

In Turkey, Thailand, and the Ukraine, there is a loss of confidence in the ability of the political system, and large scale social unrest, which is causing investors to sell assets.

In India, a large current account deficit, low economic growth, high inflation, and the paralysis of the political system is concerning investors.

China's shadow banking system is showing some cracks, as a purveyor of Wealth Management Products looks like it may default on its loan obligations.

Argentina's central bank no longer has the dollar reserves left to prop up the peso, and since no citizen actually want the peso, the central bank giving up has basically allowed the peso to rapidly devalue.

All of this is exacerbated by the tapering of Quantitative Easing by the Federal Reserve here in the US. For the last 5 years, the Fed has bought US Treasury bonds, driving interest rates here down, and squeezing investors out of the Treasury market.

All this 'printed money' has chased higher returns in these emerging markets, and a flood of what we might call 'hot money' has flowed from the developed world and into the emerging markets, which have become complacent with their high growth rates, and have used this influx of foreign investment to delay necessary reforms.

Now that the Fed is tapering, this set of currency crises is basically the giant sucking sound as capital leaves these countries where highest risk is perceived and returns to the developed world, leaving the developing world high and dry.

At some point it became ok for people to borrow large sums of money to consume things in the present that they could not afford.  This led to more demand from people that didn't have the money to pay without borrowing, and prices rose.  For example, house prices would not be nearly as high if people could not take out 30 year mortgages at artificially low interest rates (ignoring whether 30 yr mortgages are a good thing or bad).  There would be way less potential buyers to bid prices up, and sellers would need to lower prices.


The US government has encouraged this irresponsible behavior, and now people say things like, ""well how do I grow my business if I can't borrow"", or ""businesses will be hurt without access to credit to pay employees"".  I got news for you, if you need to borrow to pay your employees then you are probably a horrible business person.


In the recent past, this irresponsible behavior has spread to college loans, and everyone is paying more for a college education because the government has made it possible through guaranteed loans for people to  go to school for Comic Book Studies and Basket Weaving.  This allows the colleges to continuously raise prices faster than inflation because kids are brain washed into thinking that without a college education they will be a carny.  They think that no matter the cost of that education, it will be worth it.  The times of paying your way through college are over, and it didn't happen naturally.


People should not borrow large sums of money for consumption.  In the past, when you borrowed money, it was because that money would allow you to invest in something with a positive expectation.

A bank's business model is to create credit, saddle the population with the credit, and collect rent from the population.  In addition, bankers give free/cheaper credit to their relatives/friends to help them be more competitive.  Inflation is a side effect of this business model.

The only argument against deflation that sort of makes sense is that it is difficult to cut and lower prices and salaries.  But why is it difficult to take a salary cut?  Because of fixed mortgage/car/whatever other credit payments.  Why did you get into debt in the first place?  Because 1. you had to -- otherwise you would be outbid by those who did and 2. you can not create your own credit.  Not anymore.

If things go bad, you could negotiate with your local dealer... but try to imagine calling a bank and asking them to reduce your debt because the economy is tanking.  Large retailers such as Amazon and Target partner up with banks to make their own credit cards to reduce their transaction fees.  Businesses do payroll on revolving lines of credit.

t3_1wo14e,cf45vdi,"One of the arguments for deflation is that it helps savers and punishes excessive spending (borrowing). Think about this for a minute though. How are you going to save that money? Well most people say how about a savings account at a bank. Think about this, the bank takes your money and promises you a savings rate of say 5%. The bank is not going to just give you this money for being a good saver. They expect to use your money to earn money for themselves after paying the interest rate on your money. 

Well how does the bank earn money so they can pay you your savings rate? They loan your money out to someone, be it a business, an individual, or whomever. 

Since we have already established that deflation punishes borrowers, most rational individuals are going to be loathe to borrow if they can. This makes it very difficult for the bank to find enough people to loan money to to be able to pay you your 5% interest on your savings. In fact there may come a point where the bank will stop taking deposits. 

So if the bank won't take your money, where are you supposed to put it? I suppose you can invest it with someone, but again you run into the same problem you did with the bank (investment is another form of debt), but with this time the added risk of possibly not getting any of your money back at all. 

Really the only thing you can do is ""put the money in your mattress."" 

Are you starting to see why deflation is a bad thing for an economy? People are going to be loathe to borrow money to invest in a business or buy a house. Savers are going to have a hard time finding things to put their money in because there are so few people willing to take on debt.

Yes.

They aren't going to get rid of the second widget maker because they want to maximize profits by meeting demand.  People open businesses or work jobs to earn money, not to meet demands.

Again, the business isn't there to meet demands.  It's there to make money.  Consider this contrived example.  Suppose you start a lawn service.  You have two employees that you pay $10.00 an hour.  Together, they can mow one lawn an hour.  The lawn equipment costs you $10.00 an hour to run.  You charge $40.00 for the lawn care.  Both you and your employees are earning $10.00 an hour.  Now raise the minimum wage to $15.00.  You just lost all your profits.

[This article at the Brookings Institute](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/01/10-ripple-effect-of-increasing-the-minimum-wage-kearney-harris) points out the ripple effect of increasing minimum wage. When you increase the hourly pay at the bottom most rung, people making a little more than minimum wage get pay increases. I used to work at a place that paid $1.28 an hour when the minimum wage was $1.25. The minimum wage [went up to $1.40](http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm), and we got some amount higher than the minimum wage, but I've forgotten what.

Because we got a raise on top of the minimum wage increase, we had more money. So if I got that raise to say a buck and a half an hour, I suddenly could afford your widget, when I couldn't at a dollar twenty-eight. Demand went up because of the ripple effect -- more people could afford the widget. 

The widget maker may have to charge more for each widget, but it's not going to be the amount of the increase for each widget because it makes a hundred widgets a day, so even though the price goes up, it may be that I still can afford it at my higher pay when I couldn't afford it before the minimum wage went up. Plus I got a little extra pay on top of the increase.

You may notice from the [chart I linked to](http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm) that minimum wage has been in effect for decades. This means we have a history of minimum wage increases and [the effects each increase had on the economy](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/job-loss). Here's a quote from that page:

> Paul Krugman, Princeton University, February 2013: “Now, you might argue that even if the current minimum wage seems low, raising it would cost jobs. But there’s evidence on that question — lots and lots of evidence, because the minimum wage is one of the most studied issues in all of economics. U.S. experience, it turns out, offers many ‘natural experiments’ here, in which one state raises its minimum wage while others do not. And while there are dissenters, as there always are, the great preponderance of the evidence from these natural experiments points to little if any negative effect of minimum wage increases on employment.” (Source)

Resulting in less money towards other companies/products/services because prices increase and also less money to work with in your own company.

However, minimum wage increases hurt the jobs you're NOT thinking about.  I like to use the example of a desk girl who is employed for the simple fact that she has a nice face and simple personality that pretty much needs to greet people.  The employer doesn't care if she's doing homework or uses facebook 95% of the time.  Let's say they don't want to hire an experienced high-producing worker because that isn't what they want.  They can afford a small expenditure for a small roll in their company.  If minimum wage increases, it may very well kill that position.  Sure, that girl can't afford to raise a family in that job but she isn't meant to.  

A business puts out an ad with job responsibilities/tasks that demand almost nothing of the person.  A single mother applies to the job and suddenly our society thinks they're robbing that poor single mother who's trying to raise a family.

Even though it is mainly related to commercial construction.


When it comes to residential (especially suburban/exurban) one big component is often the price of the underlying lot.  When demand is high that component often gains a huge windfall premium for developers; when demand is low, developers can often only (barely) recoup their costs (and can only make a minimal profit on the house itself).

And relative to custom built homes, my understanding (from talking to a few builder friends last fall) is that certain material costs have dramatically increased (especially things like copper: pipes & wires ... so cheaper options {PEX} are often substituted in, and these tend to also have savings in labor costs) -- while ironically other materials (say granite/marble countertops) have gotten a bit cheaper because a significant material supply (a long-chain ""glut"" thing) still exists while the demand is significantly down (not to mention that a host of alternatives were developed and starting coming online just as the housing bubble burst).",2,1392391157.0
t3_1xrwtz,cfe34dq,"**Part 1: Qualifying for benefits**

The federal requirements are this:

>For income, individuals and households may qualify for benefits if they earn a gross monthly income that is 130% (or less) of the federal poverty level for a specific household size. For example: the SNAP-eligible gross monthly income is $1,245 or less for an individual. For a household of 4, the SNAP eligible gross monthly income is $2,552 or less. Your gross monthly income is the amount you make each month before any deductions, i.e. taxes, insurance, pensions, etc. 

>Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program#Income_Requirements

So, for a single person working 31 hours a week at the new $10.10 minimum wage, they would no longer qualify for SNAP. People with more dependents or with disabilities or who are immigrants have a different set of rules. 

You also can't qualify for SNAP if you have (again for a single person), a spare $2000 in the bank, so a 10.10 minimum wage may reduce the number of people who qualify in this way as well, but it is a little harder to get info on how increasing the minimum wage would change saving rates.

Some states such as California and Maryland allow you to get SNAP benefits at a higher income level than the federal eligibility of 130% of poverty line.

**Part 2; Qualifying doesn't actually mean that you will get a check, however, so how much money do you receive if you qualify?**

In order to be healthy and not have to go hungry, you need about $200 per person in food per month. The government assumes that you can budget 30% of your income to food, so the benefit only needs to include what you can't provide. So, even if you qualify, the benefits are decreased incrementally by how much you earn.

>To get your potential benefit, subtract 30% of your net income from the maximum allotment for the household size.

The maximum a single person can receive is $189 (it was $200 but Congress just lowered it and I did the numbers on the old $200 value), so someone working 17 hours a week at minimum wage would get:

If the minimum wage is 7.25 per hour:

200 - ($580*.3) = $52

If the minimum wage is 10.10 per hour:

200 - ($686*.3) = $0

These numbers are higher if you have dependent children. You can see them here: http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility

Conclusion: It would absolutely save the taxpayer money in SNAP expenses by increasing the minimum wage because less of the working poor will qualify and it will reduce the amount that those who do still qualify receive from SNAP, but how much depends that decreases the taxpayer's costs depends a great deal on the unemployment rate.

Generally speaking where all of those things ""align"" in a fashion that promotes a profitable business or industry, there will be high and productive employment -- wherever one or more of them act as significant barriers, then unemployment will be high.

---

EDIT: I guess the thing to realize is that unemployment (and low or no wages for labor) is much like when a stock (or really ANY good or service offered for sale) is at some ""bottom"" valuation or price.  

Is there an opportunity there? Well, maybe... and maybe not.

There is generally some (fairly solid) set of reasons WHY the stock or good is valued/priced that low.  Now people MAY be mistaken about those reasons, or some important aspect may have changed and the price does not yet reflect that change: THEN there is ""opportunity"".  But there is also *risk*... because you can't necessarily KNOW what the ""new"" valuation should (much less WILL) be, and in addition other events or changes can occur which alter the equation yet again (possibly beneficial, possibly detrimental).

And likewise, with a situation where there is a lot of available (cheap) manpower: there are undoubtedly many reasons (and risks) that underlie the WHY of the fact that others have **not** already stepped in to create a business there to both provide jobs AND to make a nice profit from it: and again chiefly that will have to do with governments & policies (and police & corruption), as well as available resources and supply chains.

Because you have to realize there are un-utilized, and even under-utilized resources ALL OVER the place. In the towns nearest me there are several (in fact many) relative modern factory buildings sitting empty and unused: all the basic infrastructure is in place and readily available (everything from relatively cheap electrical power, to natural gas, roads a nearby freeway, a not very distant port city, etc) -- and moreover there is a fairly decent sized, fairly highly educated and relatively skilled labor force that is available (and given modern machine tools, labor is NOT necessarily that critical of a cost-factor).  So why are the facilities empty?  Well, chiefly because of a plethora of ""barriers"" in the form of various permits and government policies -- but in addition, the ""supply chain"" no longer *flows* through or past the area in the way that it once did ... it has now moved overseas; so the acquisition of the ""raw"" (actually partially processed) materials is more expensive here -- so expensive that for many manufactured goods, the materials cost more than the finished product retails for when it is produced overseas (and of course the various subsidies & government policies over there *are just as important to the equation* as the ones here -- it is the discrepancy that alters the equation so substantially: there industry is subsidized, here it is burdened and taxed).",2,1393297066.0

So, in short the system exists to enable and advantage the elite who have ownership/controlling interests in these institutions, under the fraudulent pretext of providing economic stability and growth.

Abolishing central banks would free up markets to set interest rates based on actual supply and demand of capital and stop this game being run by the elites.

t3_1z4tn6,cfqw5sf,"> One idea that seems exceptionally popular, for the United States at least, was a non taxable BIG of 11,000 for every citizen regardless of wealth, with 40% of your income taxed before the BIG is applied. So if you made 20,000 a year, 8K would be taken in tax, then your BIG would raise it back to 19K

That might sound good on paper to a naive person but is terrible, terrible. What would happen in reality is the government would put tons of requirements for you to receive your handout and people would end up not getting their money back. Or they would get it late. 

People would sign on to this on the premise that the government is honest but they're anything but honest, to even consider it is laughable. The very instant they want more money (and the state machine needs money like a fire needs gasoline) they would change the rules and, oh well, it was good while it lasted.

Any person that isn't a naive kid that never worked for their cash would rightfully loathe that proposition as that puts more control in the hands of the goverment about your cash, and the less you depend on them the better off you are.

So essentially the only people that like that proposal are people who don't work for a living that are looking to get free cash and that idea might seem popular because they have so much free time to post on reddit about it.",3,1393592796.0
t3_1z4tn6,cfqslhm,"I think as a moral imperative it is terrible, and will only lead to more class warfare. 

As an economic idea designed to replace other ineffective and dehumanizing forms of welfare it is a good idea. 

Notice none of this above is an economic analysis but a social one.

But it brings me into a economic analysis. The modern welfare state at least in America is very controlling and makes people reliant on it. 

Objectively I think we can say if people are given money to use to their own ends they will to better at fulfilling those ends: even if they are not the best ends. 

But think/hope what we will find is that when people are able to use money to their own ends they will be better off. 

For example. Perhaps the person living on foodstamps would use part of that money to work towards an area of interest for them. Maybe this will lead to them being able to be hired in that skill set. 

> with 40% of your income taxed before the BIG is applied

This is where it becomes a problem. A 40% tax rate is absurd and unnecessary for those that really gain nothing from this. 

For mathematical purposes it is easier to look at a NIT with a flat rate or mildly progressive income tax on the positive side.
(but in practice a BIG and NIT can be basically the same thing)

A number of radical free market economists thought this was a good(or better) idea. 
These include Friedrich Hayek & Milton Friedman.

But Friedman for example only though it was a good idea insomuchas it was replacing all (or basically all) other forms of welfare. 

If we were to have freer markets and a BIG or NIT I think this idea could work.

t3_1zp091,cfvok2g,"The central bank sets two key interest rates:

1.) The discount window rate (currently 0.75%)

2.) The interest rate on reserves for banks (currently 0.25%) This then provides the floor rate for federal funds market at 0.25% as well.

The discount window is where banks can go as a last resort to borrow money from the central bank.

The federal funds market is where banks can go to borrow money for less than 0.75% interest, but they won't be able to borrow it for less than 0.25% interest there, because the central bank will pay 0.25% risk free, so no bank would lend their reserves to another bank at a rate below 0.25%.

So the central bank sets interest rates for commercial banks to borrow money.

But consumers like you and me can't access the discount window or the federal funds market. So when we go to a bank for a loan we can choose between various banks and that is how supply and demand determines the prevailing mortgage rate, car loan rate, credit card rate or other consumer loan rate. 

And these consumer loan rates will always be higher than the discount window and the federal funds rates that banks can get for loans from the central bank.",3,1394088207.0

t3_1zp091,cfvumpy,"Another factor to consider is [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking). This allows banks to lend out around 90% of the money they take in. That money is spent and deposited by someone else, meaning that 90% of it can be lent out again. This allows banks to charge lower interest rates than they would otherwise have to (if they kept a higher portion of their loans in reserve), but it also introduces risk of a bank run if depositors want to withdraw more than 10% of total deposits at once. To counteract this, banks limit withdrawals and central banks offer deposit insurance, effectively saying that they'll magic more money into existence if there is a bank run. This allows banks to shift the risk of fractional reserve banking onto others.

I believe that central banking and fractional reserve banking is a good way for banks to make much more money than they could in a free market. (Fractional reserve banking certainly could exist in a free market, but I don't think most banks would take that much risk without a central bank to cover them.) For starters, banks would probably charge people to hold deposits instead of paying them interest -- it costs money to keep your money safe. Interest rates on loans would be at the market rate instead of being distorted by the artificial central bank rate.",2,1394117533.0
t3_1zp091,cfvp02a,"The answer is the central bank.

The central bank sets the overnight rate for bank borrowing, the [Federal Funds Rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate).

This is the rate at which banks with surplus reserves trade with banks with deficit reserves, and is ultimately the price of risk-free money. Now this market is effectively infinite - any quantity of funds can be invested and return the overnight rate (the Fed these days simply pays interest on reserves to achieve this), and any quantity of funds can be borrowed by deficit banks at that same rate.

Banks then mark up the risk-free rate to cover risk and derive profit, and on-sell it to customers, with competitive forces between banks keeping these markups low.

Now when you have infinite supply at a fixed price, demand determines quantity, not price.

And that's basically our monetary system - the Fed says that the banking system shall be able to borrow funds at X%, banks mark that rate up to make a profit, and they sell to any and every single customer they can get to their doorsteps that can afford that markup. How many customers they can find determines the quantity of loans going out, but ultimately when you borrow money rates do not change.

That is, if you go out and acquire a mortgage, all that happens is you get the loan and more money enters the system. **Not** that interest rates imperceptibly change across the economy such that now someone else can't as some people would have you believe, that's just silly talk. ",2,1394089911.0
t3_1zp091,cfvns3b,"The answer is supply/demand.  A central bank just happens to be one supplier/demander.  Because a central bank is so large relative to other entities and they have the ability to ""make"" money their actions have a huge impact on the supply and demand of investment vehicles like T-bonds.  

As they buy up investments interest rates go down because there is more money being offered for bonds.  As the central bank buys fewer investments those that want to sell bonds will have to offer higher rates of return (interest rates will increase).

In the U.S. with quantitative easing the Fed has been buying huge amounts of bonds which has brought the interest rate of very secure bonds like those from the Treasury to be near zero.  As the Fed tapers (reduces how much they are buying) the interest rate will begin to climb again.

That said, I work in financial policy and there are a couple serious issues I would point out with your model. 

First, if you take away the entire concept of Corporate Income Tax, I, as a policy maker, can no longer use taxes as a coercive tool to encourage businesses to advance the public good. I can no longer say to a company that if they reduce their carbon emissions by X I'll knock Y% off their CIT. More critically from an economic perspective, we use CIT breaks and subsidies all the time to encourage the hiring of vulnerable demographic like the young, elderly, disabled and new immigrants. Being able to dangle policies like that with the CIT I think contributes to a healthier functioning economy overall. 

Second, we know from psychological studies that people respond very poorly to loss. If you hiked the personal income tax or consumption tax to offset your lack of CIT I think people would be so wildly uncomfortable with the higher tax rates that they'd move or mutiny. Even if it's rational from an economic perspective people usually aren't. 

Third, you would be proposing the policy at the worst possible time in terms of demographic shifts. In Canada, we're looking at a ratio (right now) of 5.4 working adults aged 15-65 supporting every one individual not in the tax base (like children, the disabled, and the elderly). Over the next decade or so, we're looking at a ratio of closer to 2.4 working adults for every one individual not in the tax base. So before any of your proposed changes are made, we're already facing a huge decline in individual revenues and your policy would make that worse.

t3_21jc05,cgdovci,"Having worked in the insurance industry, I can say the answer is not necessarily.  The profit generally doesn't come from premiums directly, and in fact the pay-out on claims across the board can outstrip the income from premiums when you consider that an individual might never use all of their money ""paid in"", but someone else will have paid in only $50,000 but used $1,000,000 in claims.  The *real* profit comes from what the insurance company does with the money while they're holding it, before they have to pay it out again.  

Hypothetically, if you're an insurance company and your plan costs $200/mo, that's a total of $2400 in premiums per person for one year.  After say 5 years, that insured makes a claim for $13,000.  That would be a net loss on the premiums alone (he's only paid 12,000 after all), but because you were investing his premiums at say a 4% return, you're only paying back $13,000 on a total of $14,533 that's attributable to his premiums.

It depends largely on the type of insurance, and I'm not as familiar with health insurance as I am with home/property/auto insurance, but it's not necessarily the case where the insurance company is taking in more than it's paying out.

IMO the most important thing to compare is the amount of stuff you can get. The salary is not and end, is a mean for you to get something.


So the 1st is to set a list of things you consume and see for yourself how much of that stuff you could get in the new country with your new salary. Indexes like the Big Mac Index or the PPP try to take this into account, but because everyone consumes differently, doing something for yourself will probably be better. You should also worry more about things you cannot buy in the international market, the service part of a trade and services in general (transportation, meals, health, etc). Of course in doing this you are already analyzing the taxes, because you need your after tax salary to calculate the amount of things you can by and the benefits of taxes in the amount of things you can get.

2nd - Savings. By definition they are what you don't consume of your salary. If considerable chunk of your salary will be savings, then the country interest rate, and capital taxes are where to look for. Also look for restrictions of movements of capital to outside the country in case you really have lots of money.

The BoE does not lend directly to the treasury. The BoE lends to the financial markets in general. The government then borrows from those markets. So it is indirect borrowing, yes, but that is a distinct difference.

However, QE is not lending to the government, not at all. QE is an unconventional form of monetary policy used when other policy options are ineffective; basically when the interbank lending rate is at or near 0% (influencing this rate is the BoEs normal tool).

QE is when the BoE buys financial assets from private sector banks and firms. Usually these are illiquid assets (assets that are hard to sell). This shores up the banks' stock of capital, which puts them in a more solid financial footing. In theory, this encourages banks to lend to firms and individuals more since they have a more firm backup of liquid funds.

The £53 billion is owed almost entirely to private (bank and firms) entities who have bought government bills and bonds (called gilt-edged securities or gilts in the UK).

The BoE charges interest because giving out interest free money would result in too much lending, an over expanding supply of money, and over inflation.

government ""tried everything"", nothing worked and no one knew what to do.  inflation went ballistic and totally ruined the economy

finally, government authorities went to Heidrick Klaut (not his name, I don't recall) who had claimed all along he knew the reason for the hyper inflation **and the solution**

Heidrick demanded they all meet him at the corner of two streets in Berlin at 3:00 AM the next morning.  the bureaucrats showed up then Heidrick told them to be silent and listen.  ""What do you hear?"" he asked

",6,1404948396.0
t3_2a9yk5,cit2tip,"As a non-American, let me remind all Americans here that the process of money creation via the commercial banking system operating alongside a central bank is pretty much the norm all over the world.

All countries have central banks, most of these banks are independent of political influence (ie incumbent politicians might be tempted to manipulate interest rates in order to keep voters happy before an election or to fulfill certain election promises). Most of these banks have inflation targets, and use monetary policy to keep prices stable.

In the case of the United States, the Federal Reserve is a ""private organization"" in that it is not directly controlled by congress, but it is still subject to congressional rule because the board itself is appointed by congress. The constitution clearly gives monetary power to congress, but there is no constitutional reason why that power can't be delegated to another entity.

Recently I've been reading Asimov for the first time, and in one of his books he points out that money is like gravity - the more you have, the more you attract. The Federal Reserve system is not set up to benefit the rich, but it benefits the rich more than it benefits the poor simply because the rich have more money than the poor do.

The thing about the modern banking system is that banks have the theoretical capacity to lend out as much money as they have deposited in them. A bank with $100 billion deposited in it can, theoretically, lend out $100 billion. (The reality is that they lend less than that. In the US there is a 10% reserve rate which prevents banks from lending more than 90% of their deposits).

So commercial banks are both borrowers and lenders. They are essential to a capitalist system which is based upon borrowing and lending.

A central bank is a government's way (or, in the case of the ECB, a monetary-area's way) of ensuring that banks operate prudently. Because central banks have the power to create money out of thin air, commercial banks will never run out of liqudity (any commercial bank in danger of liquidity can be assisted by a central bank by being able to borrow created money at low interest rates in order to maintain a liquid flow of cash. That was something they learned to do after the experience of bank runs during the great depression)

Thoughts? Theories? Disagreements?",6,1404953449.0
t3_2a9yk5,cit4ii7,"You are obviously grasping at the concept of why the FED needs to be independent of the government, and what it means if it is not subject to direct democracy.
I'd preface in saying that managing the money supply and the interest rate is a highly technical and analytical endeavor, one that even the wonks at the FED sometimes have a hard time fully understanding.
To place these decisions at the hands of an elected politician, who's mandate is not exactly based on his technical and analytical skills would be as ludicrous as handing the keys of a war tank to a 10 year old. The same could be said about handing theses decisions to a public vote, when the vast majority of the public does not have the required knowledge or mental skills to assess the impacts and consequences of these decisions.

The FED has two tiers of mandates which it works towards: 
a) keeping inflation within a certain boundary (close to 2.5%), and keeping full employment. The tools it has to do this by changing the interbank interest rate, or printing money and buying assets (Government Bonds off the secondary market) when interest rates are close to the zero boundary.
b) regulate financial markets, within the boundaries set by the current law.

Mandate a) is a fairly technical venture, but that is fairly well established. There is occasional distortion when the president or board members of the FED give in to political pressure, but they generally know what to do.

Mandate b) is slightly harder to take on. First, it implies that you have to have enough ""inspectors"" to constantly have close looks at all of the operations of financial institutions. They need to have a way to test new instruments, review contracts, and understand effects. Because of the rate of innovation, and the relatively low amount of inspectors, this is difficult to do. It is also difficult to be constantly playing catch-up to new instruments and the shadow-banking system that doesn't exactly run up to the FED and say ""Here we are, and this is what we do"".
In this task, they are also constrained by the current law. If Congress and the Senate pass a law saying that the FED can only regulate banks, but not other financial institutions, this is the limit of their scope. Similarly, if there is no law saying that exotic instruments such as CDSs need to be regulates, so again they are constrained by this.

So basically blaming the Great Recession solely on the FED is utterly misguided and naive.

If you go read up on the history of the FED, you will see that each layer of mandate and the structure of the FED actually came on organically as a response of several crises along the way. I believe it is set up in the way that it had to be set up, and that it plays an important part in keeping the system stable.

Now about the indentured servitude part, I think this comes from hearing the scare-mongering news outlets that do not actually reflect facts. I'm not saying that there is not a large portion of the population in this situation, I am just saying that this is in no way the fault or work of the FED.

My belief is that asset bubbles and crashes are more the responsibility of Congress/Senate than they are of the FED. If there had been a law about how much collateral a person needs to have to get a loan, and a limit on the number of mortgages one person could have, a lot of this would have been avoided. But in the US there is a strong feeling that a market unfettered by laws is the ultimate invisible hand that will lead to prosperity for everyone. This completely ignores the fact that banks can resort to predatory practices to push loans onto people, to make them feel like they cannot lose, to slap limitless fees on them, all before most of the people have the opportunity to understand why they should have chosen bank A over Bank B, or why they should have asked a financial planner for advice before signing onto that fifth mortgage so they could buy a boat.

No-one is obliged to take on loans and mortgages if they use their money wisely and live within the limits of their budget. No-one is obliged to load up credit cards to they can purchase now and pay a few months down the line. All of this is much more a cultural issue of ""keeping up with the Jones's"" than it is of FED-caused inflation.

There are quite a few media outlets that misrepresent the role and importance of inflation, as well as it's consequences. First of all, a higher level of inflation will do much more to make richer people worst off than the poorer. This is because with inflation, the value of wealth is eroded, thus losing value, at the same time that the value of a loan or mortgage is also eroded, thus relieving the weight of the debt. There is obviously the issue of the poor's wages keeping up with inflation, but again this is an issue with a government that bows to external influences and does not keep a minimum wage rising with inflation. 
Inflation is important because it means that the rich cannot just sit on their assets, lest they erode in value, and so they need to invest it somewhere, hopefully where it can create more jobs and enrich other people. In a scenario where you have deflation, they can just sit on their asset as it gains in value because prices are dropping. Deflation also affects companies severely. If they need to keep dropping their prices, then they need to continually drop their costs, which means either lowering wages, or firing people. It also makes investments harder because if currency is worth more next year than today, then why risk an investment that has a chance (even marginal chance) to fail? ",2,1404957268.0

1. What do you mean by legitimate? In the sense that a (large) majority of market participants respect the existence of the Fed, it is certainly legitimate.

2. It's hard to know this for sure as we can't go back in time to the Fed's creation and run forward the counterfactual scenario in which the Fed doesn't exist. What/who would control monetary policy? However, we *can* look at what other countries have done with their banking systems for clues. When we do, we see many, many examples where politicians have gone to extreme policy lengths to get short-term results at the cost of severe consequences. Here, at least, we seem to have avoided precisely those things.

3. I think those ideas reflect a number of misunderstandings about economics and the way the macroeconomy functions. A positive inflation target is a *desirable* thing as it greatly reduces the probability of a deflationary spiral. I'm not sure what you have in mind with your indentured servitude remark, but individual actors in the economy aren't generally forced to participate in any banking schemes. No one is forced to take on mortgages -- many choose to do so. No one is forced to get credit cards -- many choose to do so. In fact, we've seen that bank access is an important factor in alleviating poverty conditions -- exactly the opposite of what your theorists claim is going on.",2,1404943461.0

t3_2arkah,ciybq7k,"1) **It drives interest rates down**- all interest rates in the US, and thus, the world (for the most part) are driven by the interest rate on treasury bonds. yes, LIBOR is also a factor, but they are both so widely looked at it's like they're joined at the hip. This is also important to note becuase it lowers the cost of borrowing for the US government.

2) **It adds reserves that the banks hold at the Fed**- this in essence capitalizes the banks further.

3) **It is one of the most direct ways for the Fed to impact financial markets, and thus, the economy**- just as the government increases *spending* to drive stimulus, the Fed drives stimulus by buying/selling financial securities with artificially created money.

These are the reasons (for the most part) that the Fed pursues quantative easing- which is the thing you're asking about.

The Fed is technically not an entity of the US government- but rather a private institution that is bound to the US government. You'll have to read more on this if you're curious, but they are separate entities. The distinction isn't clear because the government officials often contradict themselves on it.

Our current policy is to continue growing debt through the Federal Reserve (and zero interest rate policies around the world) in hopes that the economy will ""catch up"" and be able to support the required levels of debt on it's own. If you ask me this is similar to taking every penny you have and buying lottery tickets, but I think you have a better chance of winning the lottery than having the greatest miracle in human history happen within the next few years (which is what would be required for this plan to work long-term).

t3_2arkah,ciygs0u,"Please ignore every single one of these other comments, except for MisterParty's ((s)he at least has some understanding of the Fed).

THE reason why the Federal Reserve does not simply purchase Treasury securities directly from the US government (i.e., US Treasury) is that the Fed wants to maintain independence from the US government.  If the Fed were to directly purchase Treasury securities from the US Treasury, the Fed would be financing the US Government's deficit. This would very quickly lead to a lack of trust in the Fed and destroy that institution's credibility. For examples of this, please look at various Latin American countries in the 1980's and how their central banks lost credibility (due to financing national deficits) and caused runaway inflation (skeptics, please note, the US has very, very low inflation).

The Federal Reserve acts as the fiscal agent for the US government - this means that it auctions off Treasury securities  on behalf of the US government to the primary dealers (these are banks that meet certain regulatory thresholds and MUST participate in these auctions, in addition to other requirements). By auctioning off these securities, the primary dealers set the market price of US debt.  Meaning, if primary dealers do not trust the US government, they can purchase these securities at a discount. From this perspective, US government debt is set at a market interest rate. Were the Fed to simply purchase securities from the US government, how would interest rates be set that reflected actual credit conditions for the US government?  The answer is that they could  not and that the interest rate on government securities would not reflect actual market-implied (and now realized) borrowing costs.

Now, does the Fed make money to purchase bonds?  The answer is yes and no.  When the Fed purchases government securities from the secondary market (i.e., at market prices), the Fed must create money out of thin air (Fed creates money, Fed gives created money to banks, banks give the Fed Treasury bills). However, when these securities become due (i.e., when that 5 year bill reaches its expiry date) the US Treasury pays the Federal Reserve the par value of the bill PLUS interest. In this way the Fed's costs are completely covered and the out/inflows net out over time.  However, the Fed does profit from this arrangement - whenever you buy a security (as an investor, as the Fed, as a bank) you will do so at a positive interest rate (except for the Eurozone which now has negative deposit rates on o/n repo at the ECB). This positive interest rate is your profit. The Federal Reserve is required (by law...set by Congress) to turn over all profits to Congress.  Technically, this is seiniorage revenue for Congress - however, this is such a paltry sum that it does not matter (roughly 80 billion per year in the past year).  If you think 80 billion is large, look at an aircraft carrier, the F-35, or the Fed's 4 trillion plus balance sheet.

What Conerly is arguing, is that if foreigners decided to stop increasing their reserves of USD, or start selling their reserves, the value of the USD would fall. In turn, he argues, the Fed would fight this by increasing the risk-free rate on USD - encouraging foreigners to buy it up/save, on the promise that if they do so they'll get *even more* USD later.

Personally, I find that a foolhardy approach to propping up an exchange rate - one that's been pursued with disastrous effect in many countries worldwide.

Understand the competition that is around the area, does your pizza restaurant have a competitive edge that will enable to succeed in another location?  

Do you enjoy working there? Would you enjoy working there more than the prospective work you would do as a welder? 

Finally if you want to invest, what kind of investment structure? What are your rights as a shareholder? What is your ownership stake? What happens in the case of share dilution? Going back to financials, how long do you estimate conservatively that you will be able to make back the principal investment.

Now referring to your other question of ""is it worth the risk to give up guaranteed money""...

It is harder and harder for younger people like you and I to depend solely on fixed salary jobs. If you want financial success, you want to build assets for yourself that generates income without you expressly there recording your hours on a time-card. 

No money is ever guaranteed. There are many risks associated with a person's whose only source of income is from his day job.

They aren't lending to consumers as much as they used to and in many cases keeping excess reserves (they're required to keep around 10 percent reserves, which is also a number set by the fed). This has also kept inflation at bay, because if they lent money as was normal for decades prior, all the new money multiplied by bank loans would have caused much more visible inflation by now.

Automation has the potential to replace nearly every job I can think of, blue and white collar. I think its a good thing. But it's a major paradigm shift to the economy. 

Is guaranteed income the right answer? Frankly I hate these discussions unless you talk about the incentives that would be created. If 10% of the population is working and effectively paying for the other 90%, what incentives are setup for those 90% to positively contribute to the economy or society? Do they get to just relax and fuck around and be uneducated, and use up resources or is there some kind of hurdle for them to clear? 

My biggest worry (which may be unfounded) is that the 90% will effective increase the population because (a) they have more time to have children and (b) their kids are being subsidized assuming they are also provided basic income as well. I'm not making a statement on who should or should not have kids, but stating that my gut reaction is that without any other incentives in place, this could cause the population of the globe to increase faster, and use up even more resources.

I don't think technological unemployment is a problem.

One of the interesting paradoxes of technology is that the more complex and powerful it becomes, the easier it is to use. Do you exactly know how your phone works? Your car? Your TV? Your computer? Google Search? Your email client? Odds are: no. But millions/billions use them effectively every day.

The real problem is society coming to grips with a new social organization pattern, with a lot of people not wanting to change, because they are scared of change.

Employment in a firm is not the only way to make money. 

Who cares if 'jobs' go away?  Good riddance. Employment is one step above enslavement and indentured servitude (in fact it is exactly indentured servitude with a somewhat more flexible indenturement period).

The obvious thing *that will happen*, and *will cause a lot of emotional distress*, but I predict will more than likely **not** cause much economic distress, is that individuals will use technology *directly* to create goods and services for others.

In other words people will *of necessity* become more entrepreneurial and creative. Just like they *of necessity* became farmers instead of hunter-gatherers.

There are a lot of stumbling blocks we've placed in the way that should be removed/changed (and will be changed one way or another, social evolution doesn't care much if a few rules are broken along the way).

1. Gut the SEC so that individuals can easily finance via crowd sourcing (kickstarter participants should receive stock shares not t-shirts).

2. Every high school student should be required to have formed at least a half dozen business ventures before graduating. If you're not educating your child on how to successfully own and operate a business, then you are setting them up for failure.

3. Abolish the IRS. Large international firms, the wealthy, etc do not pay taxes and never will, just accept the fact. Even the playing field and collect taxes only if it can be done equitably. Tax 'evasion' is only going to become easier over time for everyone. The IRS heyday of automatic payroll deductions and businesses with easily tracked bank accounts are coming to an end.

In short, make it as easy as possible for a poor, relatively uneducated person to start and/or invest in a business and compete.  That is the goal.

The goal cannot be employment, and cannot be government handouts for the unproductive. The first will create a society that looks like the Amish. The second will create a society that will suddenly and horrifically collapse once the borrowing capacity of the government is reached.

Poverty will always be a problem. Always. It's a relative measure and so there will never be a final solution. The upcoming societal shift due to technological unemployment might exacerbate it for a period as people adjust. It might just as easily free people from poverty as the poor use the technology to uplift themselves. No doubt it will be a bit of each, but I think it is possible to design a poverty fighting solution that goes with the societal trend rather than fighting it.

Personally I'd be in favor of some sort of non-means tested guaranteed income for everyone, protected from things like bankruptcy, etc. This will make it easier for the poor to take risks, which will give them the means to escape their predicament. The amount should be small enough that for the rich/median it won't mean much of anything, but the poor should be able to buy 'the basics', whatever society determines 'the basics' to entail at that time.

This effect only works when companies compete on an even playing field, and that competition keeps profits lean.  Unfortunately, we've entered an era where competition has been sidelined as a large part of our economy has moved into territories where we have created laws that allow companies to avoid it.  Technology companies have software copyright, Media companies have media copyright,  AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc use a whole mess of tactics to ensure they don't compete, and they're all managed by a financial services industry that understands that competition is the enemy of high profit.

Price-*fixing* is inefficient. Price-*collusion* can be inefficient too. But price-*discrimination* is neither more nor less efficient than the one-price model.

Efficiency means the maximization of total utility, which is the area between the supply and demand curves. In fact, for indivisible goods, those ""curves"" are really just histograms of utility.

On Thursday, one of the Fed board members suggested continuing QE. The market saw that as a hint that more money would come into the market, creating higher prices. To get in before that happens, people bought, causing stocks to rise on Thursday and Friday.",5,1413720625.0

t3_2jppeh,cle1t5l,"You can pick up a lot from Wikipedia articles:

- Start with history -- [The Bretton Woods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference) conference. Learning a little about [Milton Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) also helps with context.

It's not simple to understand everything you ask, so you need to dig and learn context. Like, if someone said, ""what causes gravity?"" a simple answer wouldn't be sufficient.

But I'll give you a few simple answers and you can go digging:

- Bonds -- a way to raise money. Say the CEO of Ford came up to you and said, ""We need $900. So, I'll sell you 10 pieces of paper for $90 each, and in one year you can redeem each piece of paper for $100."" Those pieces of paper are bonds. the reality is more complex, though. For example, say you then sold a few of the pieces of paper to your buddy for $92, or say someone on TV said, ""Ford could go bankrupt in six months.""


- Gold standard -- Notice above how the pieces of paper called ""bonds"" are kind of like money. You can trade them with someone else. Money is just a piece of paper. A $100 bill literally has no value -- it's just paper. But you believe you can get $100 in groceries or gas with it, and you know everyone else does, and everyone's combined belief kind of gives it its value. Well, that trust everyone has could collapse. And fifty years ago, to make sure it didn't collapse, every U.S. dollar was literally redeemable for gold. The government kept gold for all of its money and, even if you weren't sure whether a grocery store would take a flimsy little  piece of paper and believe they should give you $100 of food for it, everyone knew the government would provide $100 of gold for that paper, so they trusted it and money worked.

- Dow Jones and S&P are similar things. Imagine I wanted to know whether people in North Dakota were getting richer or not. One way would be to go on eBay every day and look at the prices for the same things for sale from North Dakota -- say, all the 32"" colour TV sets and all the 2006 Honda Civics and all that. If you took the average ""Buy Now"" price of all those things every day, then, if it went up or down that might tell you something. The Dow Jones and S&P are that, but for stock market prices. The Down Jones is just a number someone works out based on the stock prices of 30 big companies -- Microsoft, etc. People figure that, if the average of those 30 prices goes up or down, it tells you something about the country -- since little tiny companies can go up or down for lots of reasons. 
- A hedge fund is a way to invest money for rich people. Usually, investing is very regulated -- very controlled by the government. But, if you're rich, the rules change a bit and if you can invest a lot of money then by choosing to invest in a hedge fund you will choose to have less protection from the government, but potentially a better return.
- The value of a dollar changes because it's relative to other currencies. Let's say $1 was the equivalent of 1 euro. But then say Germany and France agreed with the U.S. to buy Maine for $1 trillion. First, they would need to buy a bunch of U.S. money before they can pay for Maine. So if they went to people and said, ""we want to trade you 1 trillion euros for $1 trillion"" people might say, ""that's a lot of money for me to sell you, so I think I'd rather get 1.1 trillion euros instead."" So Germany and France would be forced to pay a little more of their currency to get the U.S. dollars, and that would then become the exchange rate. In reality, this happens millions of times a day for smaller amounts, so no one person can influence it -- we just feel like the price is being set when in fact it's just fluctuating up and down.

[Here's Kenneth Arrow's seminal work on the economics of healthcare](https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/53.5.941-973.pdf). [And here's a paper on recessions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/2m80ut/pdf_reconciling_hayeks_and_keynes_views_of/cm1rvit?context=3).  All of these use or are compatible with rational expectations, and they all consider cases where the free market doesn't work so well.  (Note: these are all fairly readable; check out the voxeu link in my comment for the last one.)

Why does it seem like economics and rational expectations supports free markets?  Well, it's because you're only in your second year of economics, and [you need to learn how to walk before you run](http://chrisblattman.com/2012/01/11/how-much-economics-should-you-study-in-college-or-why-economics-is-like-a-martial-art/) :).  Cases where the free market works well are generally the easiest to model and teach.  ""Breaking"" the free market generally requires adding more constraints or market imperfections.  We could start you off with graduate-level economics, but trust me, you don't want that :).  Even PhD students start with models where the free market work well for the first semester!

After [Lucas 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique), economists try to model interactions from ""fundamental"" or ""policy-invariant"" parameters.  These are usually preferences, constraints, etc.  If we don't, then our models can't evaluate the effectiveness of policy changes.  A change in policies would change parameters in the model in ways the model can't account for.

Rational expectations also has the advantage of being easier to justify.  If an effect occurs even when people are aware of how things work, it's probably robust.  If an effect occurs only because people are dumb, will this still hold when there are some very smart people in the real world (or maybe the solution is education)?  The important economic agents are the ones on the margin -- generally allowing other people to be irrational doesn't change outcomes if people on the margin are rational.

There's only one way to model rational expectations, but there are an infinite number of ways to deviate from it.  Not only would we have to justify the assumption that people are dumb, we also have to justify the specific way in which they are assumed to be dumb.

That's why we use rational expectations.  On the other hand, there are cases in the literature where rational expectations are not used.  The [literature on financial bubbles](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1345.pdf) often moves away from rational expectations, generally with agents who trade randomly (for reasons outside of the model, e.g. liquidity needs). There has also been some work done on [ambiguity aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_aversion) in light of the [Ellsberg paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox).  Surprise!  Academic economists who think about these things all day aren't stupid either ;).

**TL;DR:** Rational expectations works pretty well.  Rational expectations doesn't only justify free markets and is perfectly compatible with poorly-functioning markets.  Rational expectations are used to examine what happens if policies change.  Rational expectations is easy to justify.  Economists have moved away from rational expectations where appropriate.",6,1416126683.0

t3_2mffy6,cm3x239,"Rational decision making assumptions found their way into macroeconomics as a result of the [Lucas Critique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique) of macroeconomic models.

I would think of using rational expectations and rational behaviour as a way of simplifying the consumer side of things so you can look at whatever else it is that interests you.  For example, saying that a consumer is perfectly rational lets you leave that aside the possibility that poor consumer decisions caused an economic downturn and look at other things that you might be more interested in at the time like sticky prices or similar.

Then, if you thought there was some connection between consumer rationality and how prices are propagated through the economy, you could add in some behavioral economics into the consumer's expectations or behaviour.

t3_2mwjxk,cm97m2f,">Anyone can create money. The problem is getting accepted. -- Hyman Minsky

The thing to remember is that all money is a form of debt of the entity that issued it. Think of it like this: If you take a beer from a friends fridge and say ""I owe you one"" you have just created credit. You are now in debt 1 and your friend how has an IOU from you as an asset. Now if you write that IOU down on a piece of paper and your friend gives it to another friend in payment of something your IOU has just been used as money. However this depends on the third friend accepting your IOU. If he has never met you he's not going to take it. If he's good friends with you then he probably will. So why do people accept bank IOUs and government IOUs?

Well people accept government IOUs because lots of people owe the government in the form of taxes. If I owe $100 in taxes and I have a $100 IOU of the government I can give the government back its own IOU and cancel the debt I owe. But what about banks?

Contrary to how it appears bank created money is different than government created money even if they are denominated in the same unit (dollars, euros, yen etc). Also each bank issues money that is different from every other bank. This was obvious back in the days before there were central clearing houses for intra-bank transactions. Back then you would find banks issuing actual paper notes instead of their money existing only on accounting ledgers like they do today. So you would have Chase dollars, Bank of America dollars, etc and each would have an exchange rate with each other like foreign currencies. 

One of the main reasons for creating the Fed and central banks like it was equalize bank issued money. Now instead of having $1 Chase dollar = $2 BoA dollars or something like that they all trade at $1:$1. This makes bank money and government money more or less interchangeable and it often makes sense to analyze in such as way but not always.

So why can banks ""create money""? Because they, like anyone else, can issue IOUs but, unlike everyone else, they have a central bank backing theirs to make them interchangeable with government IOUs, at least as far as the private sector is concerned.",2,1416598910.0
t3_2mwjxk,cm8h4mh,"Money is a tool used to make transactions and negotiate contracts without having to resort to barter or IOUs measured in more volatile things. In order to perform this task well, it has to be a controlled artificial store of value that is easy to trade. It has to have a predictable value compared to other things so that contracts and prices an be set in a predictable way.

One good metaphor for central banks is them being rental stores for money. You can view them as ""creating money out of thin air"" or as always having an infinite supply of it but they always choose to lend out only a controlled amount of it so as to make it value stable and predictable in the economy.

When central banks lend out money, they don't just give it to banks for nothing. Banks, actually have to put up collateral of high quality (usually government bonds, sometimes other securities), and they owe the money back to the central bank plus they owe interests. So money from the central bank is no good to banks unless these banks can lend it out in the economy and make more interest than what they have to pay to the central bank. Central banks use their interest rate to control how much money gets lent out, the higher the rate, the higher it costs to hold money, especially relative to a dropping real value of money, the less banks and people want to hold it. The amount of money circulating determines how much it is worth. A larger supply of money, makes money worth less compared to other things: supply and demand.

If you don't like the rental store metaphor you can also see central banks as simply buying things in exchange for money. They only buy things that offer a low risk return. The interest rate is how much they want of this safe return to consider buying something and giving out money.

Central banks also return the interest profits they make on money to the government. This is called seigniorage and is usually not important amounts. It prevents the interest payments to central banks from shrinking the amount of money out there, so they don't have to lend ever more money just so the economy can pay interests on money to central banks.

Money can be lent out multiple times because when it gets lent out it usually is deposited back in a bank, banks have to keep a fraction of the money at each step in what is called fractional reserve banking. This is good, it means money is tied to the real economy, people and businesses have to work, produce goods and services to repay loans and make money move.",3,1416528808.0
t3_2mwjxk,cm894yg,"Well it depends on your definition of ""thin air"". Let's take a step back and look at what money is. Money, at the basic level, is trust that something has and will have value.

A gold coin has value today and we trust that people in the future will still desire that coin. Now if there was a zombie apocalypse I bet that heavy, impractical gold would have far less value than something like bullets.

Now the U.S. government has value (stop laughing) we trust that people will want the services it provides like police, fire, courts and military now and in the future. (This is going somewhere I promise.)

Ok so now we have a bank with a million dollars in it. The government wants this bank to lend more. But the bank can't because it has to keep that million to cover all it's accounts. So the government writes the bank an I.O.U. for another million at a low interest rate. 

Now the bank benefits because A) It has $2 million in assets, (it's original million + an I.O.U. valued at another million) and B) because it can lend the government's money out at a higher interest rate.

Since everyone expects the U.S. to honor it's debts it can ""borrow"" money at a lower interest rate, while countries like Zimbabwe have to borrow against more stable assets like dollars or gold.",3,1416514053.0

t3_2nun3a,cmh3y11,"The idea of a universal currency has both good and bad implications.  I guess I can explain some basics, but the issue is much more complicated.  People are free to add to this if they would like.

The good: It is universal within the eurozone.  This encourages consumption and trade across borders, as there is no currency exchange cost and you can travel to other countries with the same money and not have to worry about exchanging it.  Free trade is a key element for member states, as it encourages the free exchange of goods and services across borders, thus improving the economy.  The benefits are also political, as member states would not want to ruin their trading relationships with other members (thus discouraging wars, etc.).  I like the idea, personally, purely from this standpoint.

The bad:  Individual countries lose the power to print their own money.  This is important for the overall currency union, as it prevents those members from inflating the currency value too much, but it also prevents those members from using inflation for short-term benefits.  A good example of this is the recent Greek debt crisis, whereby Greece owed ~300 billion euros in debt, which was bigger than their entire economy, let alone their government balance sheet (they didn't have to pay back 300b right away, but the payments on this were too high for the government to sustain).  They did not (and do not) have the power to print euros to make payments on the debt and can only issue bonds to raise capital.  These bonds, because of the ratings on their debt (which were junk, meaning they could not get a good deal for selling bonds), were not enough to raise money to make payments.  Because they were in the Eurozone, a Greek default would reflect poorly on the euro and devalue the currency significantly, which scared member nations, and the Eurozone and the IMF loaned them the money they needed.

Those are some basic points.  The debate is ongoing of whether it is ""good"" or ""bad"" and it probably will continue for a while.",2,1417372270.0
t3_2obgam,cmlitwf,"**A brief background on the relationship between the fed and treasury (and how money is created)**  Fed issues Fed reserve notes in exchange for Treasury bills/debt.  This puts those fed notes into the system (increases money) and takes T-Bills out of the system.  In 2009 fed bought tons of T-Bills and released a lot of Fed notes into the system.  All these T-Bills (along with some other securities) are what caused the Fed Balanace to balloon to 20% of GDP.  In order to get back down to a blaance sheet of 5% of GDP, the fed eventually will have the treasury pay back (to the fed) the principal on these fed held T-Bills.  Seems easy right?  well where does the Treasury get all this money to pay back the principal?  They have to sell more Treasuries to the general public, who will pay back the treasury in federal reserve notes, then the treasury will give these notes back to the Fed so everyone's books are balanced.  Whats the catch?  Well if interest rates are higher, as they were after 1960 when the fed continued to reduce its balance sheet? 

when the treasury is paying back the fed, then the someone must buy these higher interest rate new T-Bills.  Who does this? The public of course.  But this has a dampening affect.  The treasury has to issue a TON of new t-Bills to roll over current expenses etc AND to pay back the fed..so much more than in a steady state where Fed/treasury etc are all in balance (ie spend what you earn, etc).  This Huge issuance of T-Bills which must be soaked up and bought by the general public can only be paid for in one thing...Federal Reserve Notes.  As these T=Bills are bought for Reserve Notes, the Reserve Notes are given back to the Fed.  in effect this takes money out of the system, reducing the overall money supply.  Now lets check..Is this what happened after WW2...did Money supply drop from 1945-1984?",2,1417741579.0
t3_2obgam,cmlsudf,"There are two general dimensions to consider in all of this. 

One is the activation of new post-ww2 institutions like the World Bank, IMF and IBRD in support of Bretton Woods and programs like the Marshal Plan, etc. Without knowing much about the actual balance sheets of these newly born giants in the early years, it might be useful to consider the general ""internationalization"" of central bank functions and that balance sheets where not so much shrunk but rather transferred to other peer central banks to stabilize their balance sheets and fill global development/war interests during and after the Cold War.

Second, I think the shear size of the prime banks (primary dealers), the repo markets (shadow banking) and passage of Graham Leach Bliley effectively let the banker djinn out of the bottle and that bank today are just way more powerful than during the Depression and early war years.

Considering the banks profit from the current QE systems and are in fact the strict shareholders of the fed systems, if just do not see how or why the Fed (acting as the regulator of its shareholders) would otherwise deflate their role in controlling the ""market"" economy. A corollary to this is the Fed buying stocks complements of the CME Group's Central Bank Incentive Program, which just got renewed for all of 2015.  The Fed is buying S&P500 futures for all of 2015?  Does not sound like those guys are letting go of anything anytime soon.

The funny thing is markets are run by information (who has it and who doesn't).  Under this precept, it will be clear that the insiders will know what will happen before policy is understood by markets.  The problem is they will be on the winning side of those trades regardless of if or when the Fed chooses to contract its balance sheet.

Who or what else is going to enact a change form the present regime - except war.

The race is still on to meet Basel III metrics. Japan is still the canary in the coal mine. How much longer can the Fed keep buying US debt and keeping rates under 3%?

For the free movement of people I share the pov of Hoppe and part of the libertarian ideology, see [The Case for Free Trade and Restricted Immigration](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/13_2_8_0.pdf).

The idea is that people move differently from goods. Goods cannot move on their own and require that sender and receiver agree on the shipment and then that every actor involved in between agrees on participating. Moreover, once the goods arrive to the receiver, the receiver has interest on keeping them away from other people and has the duty of not causing any harm or nuisance to its neighbors.
People cannot be treated that way, they're more ""complicated"", in particular they're independent beings.
An immigrant may come over another country either because he can afford the trip, if there's a completely ""open border"" policy, or because someone is going to profit from his work, if we assume immigrants are allowed to enter depending on them having a job. Moreover the person buying the job and justifying the immigrant's presence is responsible only for the immigrant's job. The immigrant is thus left on his own free to go whenever he want, after he finishes working.

So, unless you can show me that buying a foreign jumper or a can of a foreign food poses as much problems as having someone, from a different country, come here to live and work, I'd say free trade is easier to handle than free immigration.

Then, if you assume that free trading can screw people over, because of social dumping or similar phenomena, free immigration can do that too.

t3_2q5cid,cn34os2,"when you need to borrow money, you might go to the bank to take out a loan. Well Governments and Companies sometimes need to borrow money too, and in these occasions they sometimes they take loans from banks just like you would.

However, since governments and companies are SO big (compared to you and me), their loans need to be for a really big amount of money. And sometimes, ONE bank on it's own doesn't have all of that money. So what the government or Company decides to do is borrow a little bit of money from Lots of people, kind of like Crowdfunding. And that is basically what a bond is; it's a publicly issued security where individuals can decide to lend to a particular company or govt. When you buy a bond, it means you are lending a certain amount of money to the borrower of the bond. There are specific terms and conditions that the bond is written under; like interest rate, maturity, and a multitude of other options.


so now that we've established that a bond is just a fancy word for a public loan, let's discuss how a bond is issued. When a government or business wants to take out a loan it could just make an announcement to the public and handle this process themselves, but this is hard work that requires a specialty type of knowledge. That's why a Govt or Company typically hires a bank to help them with the process. The bank is very good at filing all the paperwork that it takes to issue a public security. (in the USA the Securities Exchange Commission is the regulator for this type of thing). When a new bond is being created, the regulatory body assigns it a serial number ( Called a CUSIP). That CUSIP will help us identify the bond in question later.

The bank that has been hired also has a very strong network of investors that it commonly offers services to. Some of these investors may even be other governments or companies! When a new bond is created, the bank contacts all these investors and they see what the demand is like for this particular bond they are creating. Sometimes the bond is not very attractive (because the borrowing govt or company doesn't have a good reputation), and sometimes everyone wants it (because the borrower has a great reputation). This reputation will help determine the interest rate of the bond.  If no one wants this bond, the borrower will have to offer a high interest rate for it to be an attractive investment enough for an investor to buy. In the markets, there is an inverse relationship between the amount of risk you're taking on to buy an investment versus the amount of reward the investor requires to assume that risk.  A really risky investment would have no investors if it offered a bad reward! that's why they have to compensate with a high reward to attract the investors. Remember though, that this reward is not guaranteed; it's actually ""really risky"" and you will most likely lose rather than win.

so let's say that there's a particular gov't or company that you want to invest in, and that you're already decided in investing in their BONDS. in rare cases, you can contact the government/business directly to become a lender. This is called Private Placement and is usually reserved for a very special, high net worth, sophisticated investor.

usually, you will invest in bonds through the public markets. You will have to contact a broker to get access to this. (A Broker is much like a car dealership or real estate agent that has access to a larger pool of buyers and sellers of the exact bond you're looking for.) i know what you're thinking now; ""why do i have to get a broker to get access to this?"" It's because each exchange that carries the bond has fees and regulation and memberships; something that would get extremely costly for you as an individual to hold up. Therefore a broker does that stuff for you and gets a bulk discount because he has many clients.

So you would tell your broker "" I Want to invest in the bonds of the Government of Brazil and i also want to invest in the bonds from the Walt Disney Company"". Your broker would then show you a list of all the available CUSIPs that fit the description of what you're looking for.  Sometimes, a govt or company will issue lots of different bonds with different maturity dates and interest rates, and payment plans. You have to do enough research to make sure that you're happy with the security you end up purchasing.  All you do from there is tell the broker how many bonds you want to buy and they will tell you how much the bond is costing in the current markets. And then you pay for the bonds with your cash, and the broker will hold the bonds for you in an account.

yes you can do it through etrade. etrade is just one of many brokers out there. etrade was one of the earlycomers to the 'online discount brokerage' business model and they are a perfectly fine broker. I would add that many of the traditional 'brick and mortar' brokers have also expanded their online offerings and therefore etrade is no longer the big fish it used to be. however, using a different broker  SHOULD NOT affect the price of the bonds you are buying since every different broker will be looking at the SAME MARKET out there. If there is any cost difference at all, that will be from the broker's individual fees that they may charge for each transaction.

If you already own the bond that means you will have an account with the broker of your choice. The EXCHANGE (or regulatory body that governs publicly traded securities) will make sure that the borrowing govt or company makes all of its payments to the bond holders, and your Broker will make sure that all the payments and installments are paid into your account proportionately with the amount of bonds that you own.

t3_2qtlaz,cn9z6ly,"There are a lot of pretty bad answers (and some good ones) so I think I'll add just one more thing that might help some people out and clarify their ideas. There are multiple ways to grow an economy, this is possible through population, division of labor, trade, increasing the capital stock, and finally technological change. We can look at each below:

Population: We can call this Malthusian Growth. Let's say we have a population of 10 people producing x amount of goods, so that each person consumes x/10. If population doubles but there are no other changes, the total amount of goods will become 2x, thus the economy is twice as big. However, because there are now 20 people, individual consumption will be 2x/20 or simply 10/x i.e. unchanging. While the economy doubles in size, individual consumption is unchanged and thus this isn't really a good way to grow an economy.

Division of Labor: We can call this Smithian Growth. Imagine if that group of 10 people we have were each self-sufficient producers of an identical basket of goods. It makes sense that if each person specialized in a type of good and traded with each other that each could carry out their individual task more efficiently thus producing a larger total volume of goods. Here we have increasing consumption so that rather than each individual consuming x/10 we have an increased consumption of yx/10 where y>1. This is the type of growth we want, however, without updated methods of production this type of growth has an upper limit. There is an optimal organizational form that the division of tasks for production can take and beyond this growth will not continue.

Trade: This can be called Ricardian Growth. This is pretty similar to Smithian growth but the idea is increasing trade between economies rather than within economies. If we have a self-sufficient farming economy and a self-sufficient pastoralist economy, and then these economies decide to engage in trade, each economy can focus only in what they do best. Different geographies lead to different comparative advantages, so if England is great at manufactured goods and sucks at producing wine and Portugal is great at making wine but sucks at manufacturing, both economies benefit by pursuing the tasks they are relatively best at and trading. This leads to per capita increases in income as well but as with Smithian Growth only up to a certain point.

Increase the Capital Stock: This can be called Solowian Growth. If our economy decides that it is going to save more and invest those savings in increasing the productive stock i.e. forgoing current consumption, then the increase in capital will allow for an increase in the productivity of labor and an overall larger economy. As before, increasing savings (savings = investment) will reach an upper limit on the growth it provides. As the capital stock increases so will the amount of depreciation so that for each level of investment, a steady state is reached where investment = depreciation. We can grow the economy by forgoing consumption to increase investment, but like the previous types of growth, there is an upper limit.

Technology: We can call this Schumpeterian Growth. This is the type and the only type of growth that can be indefinite. This is the type of growth we talk about when we describe the process that brings a country from poverty to riches. For underdeveloped and developing countries, this largely means emulating the technologies of more advanced economies. For economies like the US this is why R&D is so important. The other forms of growth can be extremely important in short to medium time horizons, but for indefinite growth, the only answer can be technological innovation.

To sum up, population growth is not a good form of growth because it does not lead to increases in per capita incomes. Growth through more efficient divisions of labor, international trade or increased investment are good in that they lead to increases in per capita terms, but only up to a certain point. Technology can grow an economy indefinitely provided that we don't pollute and destroy the natural environment so much that it reaches a point of collapse that we can do nothing about, which kinda seems like the path we are on right now…",9,1419995074.0

China became the dominant source of growth in crude-oil demand as it joined the world economy in recent decades. Indeed, Société Générale comments China’s opening to world trade was responsible for lifting the oil price from around $20 a barrel to around $100. This price move approximately correlates with China joining the World Trade Organization at the beginning of the last decade, a period in which the nation, by itself, added the equivalent of Japanese and U.K. total oil consumption.

The oil market is unlikely to find another country, or even a continent, that can take over this degree of heavy lifting in demand growth.

Meanwhile, longer-term forecasts that China can maintain anything close to its recent pace of growth increasingly look misplaced.

Until recently, many economists had assumed that it was only a matter of time before China’s appetite for oil would surpass that of the U.S. But there are a number of reasons to question such bullish forecasts.

For one, we can expect the Chinese investment cycle to be in for a prolonged adjustment as it digests past excesses. There is widespread evidence of industrial overcapacity, and last week researchers at China’s National Development Commission became the latest to highlight this issue. In a new report, they estimated $6.8 trillion of “ineffective investment” had been wasted.

There are other signs that China’s thirst for oil is coming up against capacity constraints. After surpassing the U.S. as the biggest automobile market in the world in 2010, recent years have seen traffic jams and pollution become recurring problems. This has forced authorities to use administrative measures to rein in growth.

We should also expect China’s future demand for oil to be more price-sensitive. In the past, demand appeared inelastic as growth continued even as crude prices reached triple-digits. But this period coincided with state-funded industry being the dominant driver, whereas demand for gasoline for cars can be expected to be dependent on the income growth of the middle class.

Already China’s diminished oil appetite is showing up in various data. According to BP’s annual Statistical Review of World Energy released last June, the U.S. outpaced China’s growth in 2013 oil consumption, the first time it’s done so since 1999. The International Energy Agency has moved to lower its annual forecast for Chinese oil demand five times so far this year, last pegging growth at 2.3% for the current year.

Not surprisingly then, China’s ability to continue its historic role as a source of oil demand is increasingly in doubt. According to Platts, China’s oil import demand rose 2.9%, year-over-year, in October, yet it was down 2.5% versus September. They also described an “unprecedented development,” in which China became a net oil exporter in October, as imports dropped 22% and exports surged 30% to a record high. China could now become a net exporter of oil going forward.",36,1420399004.0

t3_2rbgcx,cnecqae,"You can look at this issue from many different viewpoints, because there are lots of different actors at play. 

The overall recovering US economy will make the borrowing of US dollars more expensive. The ""carry trade"" is the borrowing of cheap money to invest in high-yield investments in other currencies. If it costs nothing to borrow US currency, and buying a UK bond yields 3.6% interest (just for example), then anybody that is paying attention will jump on that game as a cash cow. 

The problem with this is that the groups making these high risk investments with cheap dollars, they become vulnerable when the interest rates of the dollar go up. And if too many groups jump on the same train, then entire economic sectors are at risk if that train crashes. 

What sectors could be at risk? 

Real estate, infrastructure projects, stock and commodity futures, anything relatively high-risk, high-reward could take an enormous hit all at once if the money keeping these industries afloat suddenly disappears. 

For anyone who has investments in those indutries, including workers in those industries and people who have their 401k plans, it would be a total disaster.

You're thinking of the government like a personal account, which isn't a bad place to start, but there are some key differences to bear in mind. As an individual you wouldn't think twice about taking out a mortgage to get a house right? Sure you'll have a massive debt, but you'll pay it off eventually. So the government does that, but it buys a new house every couple of years. As an individual that doesn't make sense (why buy a second house?), but the government is actually growing. There are more people in the country so every few years you need another ""house"". So while an individual would never likely do this (because you don't multiply into more people) a government or corporation may. The decision is roughly the same: they need some large purchase today, and will pay for it over time. This decision is continually repeated, to the point that they're paying off loans made many years ago but also opening new ones because they still need more ""houses"".

So long as the economy (and therefore tax revenue) is increasing this makes perfect financial sense. But this is risky... just as you may lose a job and miss mortgage payments many thing may cause tax revenue to fall. Detroit is an example of this going bad... the city took out loans expecting to pay them off over 20-30 years, but then started losing businesses and population. So they build things (let's say a new house, just to keep the relationship to individual mortgages), but then the people using that house decided to move out. Sine the loan is to the city, and not the people who would have lived in the ""house"", they're left with a house they don't need but still have to pay for.  In reality the ""house"" is actually some city service (water and sewer lines, garbage trucks, roads, couthouses, etc...). So don't think ""they should force the people living in the house to pay when they move out"" because that is taking the metaphor too literally... the government made investments expecting to be serving so many thousands of people, but then several thousand moved out (in some cases abandoning houses and property), leaving the city with the capacity to offer more services than it needed to and a debt still left to pay.",6,1422088457.0

t3_2xafu2,coyt50r,"As is often the case, there are bits of truth and falsehood in this. This is not my area of expertise, so I don't know where the current research lies, but let's try to chip away at the issue.

One could start from Ricardo's theory of Comparative Advantage and say that goods should be produced where they are comparatively cheapest, but [this article](http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/25/opinion/op-marglin25) for instance argues that we don't live in Ricardo's world anymore: technology is mobile rather than fixed to particular countries; workers no longer consume what they produce  or own the means of production, so they may not reap the profit from the exchange; labor markets aren't particularly efficient, so hours and wages don't adjust smoothly. So maybe your friend is right: outsourcing can benefit owners and consumers while hurting workers. Since people are generally a mix of these three types, **the benefits will be unevenly distributed.**

However the idea that outsourcing doesn't lower the price of most goods is just plainly false. Let's look at the iPhone.

The iPhone 5's total unit cost is around [$290](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-cost-what-apple-is-paying/). After taking out retailer markup, that leaves Apple with around $290 in profit for a net margin of 100%. That's pretty high, but then again this is Apple we're talking about, which apparently had [the most profitable quarter in corporate history](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/27/apple-record-quarterly-earnings-report-iphone-6-plus), so not exactly representative of an average.

Now what if they manufactured state-side? The [average manufacturing wage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2012/01/25/the-real-reason-the-u-s-doesnt-make-iphones-we-wouldnt-want-to/) in 2010 was $2 in China and $34.75 in America. We don't know how many man-hours go into an iPhone, but [this estimate](http://www.asymco.com/2012/02/22/the-iphone-manufacturing-cost-structure/) says it could be as low as 4 or much higher, but we'll take 4-7 hours as our range. In China, that gives a labor cost between $8 and $14. Moving to America, this becomes $139 to $243.25. **So with some back-of-the-envelope math, we've managed to halve or obliterate the profits from the most profitable item sold by one of the most profitable companies in the world.** If you think that wouldn't increase prices, you're insane.

To bring in another common argument: while Apple's manufacturing occurs overseas, their white collar jobs are largely still here. These pay better and are more desirable. If manufacturing costs were significantly higher, would Apple employ as many programmers? Would they pay them as much? I don't know. And when the US loses jobs, a foreign country gains them. Should we consider this a net loss to the world? (In terms of pollution, probably yes, but not necessarily for jobs or standard of living.)

So this is a complex issue, and I don't know the answer. Hopefully someone who knows trade literature better can weigh in, but I'd say your friend's analysis is naive at best.

**TL;DR: Outsourcing probably does benefit society unevenly, but that doesn't mean we'd be better off without it, and it definitely does lower the price of consumer goods. And anyone claiming to fully understand an issue as complex as this one definitely doesn't.**",2,1425031821.0

t3_2xfr0i,cozwq4h,"Great question! I work in economic policy and I'm happy to chime in on this one. 

The short answer is that political interests and regional concerns typically prevent this from happening.

The long answer:

**Point 1**

If you allow for a manual increase in the minimum wage (rather than pegging it to inflation) you provide politicians with the opportunity to be economically relevant. For example, Ontario Canada recently increased the minimum wage to $11. The party that did it (Liberals) got to use that increase in a lot of political messaging. A party to their left (NDP) argued the increase wasn't enough and should instead be $12. The party on the right (PC) argued the increase was too much and would hurt job growth. All three parties staked out political positions and they used that to fight over a low wage demographic they want to vote for them. They have no interest in building in an automatic increase in the minimum wage that prevents their ability to seem economically in tune with an 800,000 strong voting block. 

Here is an article on that increase: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ontario-hikes-minimum-wage-to-11-an-hour/article16604931/

**Point 2**

Regional CPI is tough to apply in real life. I know that Canada has an urban and rural CPI like most countries. But to be honest I don't know if we have a regional CPI within each area of each province (like rural eastern Ontario, rural northern Ontario, urban southern Ontario etc.). That matters because for us, it's each province that sets the minimum wage. And the regional differences in our economy (from province to province and within province's) are huge. 

More practically though, it is really politically unpopular to give what seems like a better deal to people that live in a big city than a rural area. In Ontario, there is a big electoral divide between people that live in Toronto (our biggest city and driver of 40% GDP growth) and everywhere else. Frequently, Toronto will get a bad deal on some political issue because politicians are fighting for votes outside of the city and Toronto's an easy punching bag. I imagine the dynamic is very similar to New York City and up-state New York. 

So even though it would make economic sense to you and I to peg the minimum wage to regional inflation, political parties would be nervous with minimum wage figures that show higher wages in Toronto than ... really anywhere else!

**In conclusion:**

There is a lot more politics in economics than I think most people realize. In most types of economic policy, the sitting government likes to keep a hand on every economic lever to make them (1) seem relevant (2) seem like they're doing good things. I think the system you described is possible, but it would take a very unique political climate to make that happen.

Fair warning: I'm by no means an expert, or even consider myself relatively knowledgeable in the process of QE. However, I can help you out a bit. First off, QE *does* create ""new money"". If you know about open market operations (OMOs) -- QE is a lot similar. With OMOs, the central bank will purchase bonds from banks using high-powered money. The QE that we've seen in the US is different in that the bank not only purchases government bonds, but also purchase assets that it does not normally purchase, such as mortgage-backed securities. All of this is done using high-powered money. 

A simplified answer to the rest of your question (and I admit to not being able to answer it properly) is the following: By injecting the banks with capital, the Fed hoped to end the credit crunch and spur lending. However, the problem was that the banks mainly kept the capital in the form of excess reserves instead of lending it out. This can be seen in the following graph provided by the Fed: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?width=630&height=378&range=Max&id=EXCRESNS

So, to answer your question, there was worry of hyperinflation because the Fed *was* creating new money. It didn't work too well because commercial banks were holding a lot of the capital as excess reserves. 

You'll need someone with a better understanding to tell you why certain parts of the economy benefited more than others i.e. labour market.

Greece can't get it's act together, and in reality, would probably be better off outside the Eurozone, because then it could devalue its currency, make its exports more appealing, and be forced to get its tax cheats to stop cheating, rather than blaming those mean old Germans for not giving them unending streams of money. Meanwhile, a good chunk of Europe is worried about Russia's increasingly volatile behavior, and unemployment is high, so that's not helping matters much. 

Then there's the good old U.S.A., which, despite all its problems, (some of which are significant, like having 33% of Americans over the age of 16 out of the workforce, the highest percentage since 1978), is still the world's only superpower, with both military and cultural prowess unmatched by any other nation on the planet. 

China, which is a rising contender, is pretty much a military nonentity, except for threatening its neighbors over various islands,  and seems to be losing the soft power war, as you can't have a worthwhile culture without a robust counterculture, and if that's being forcibly suppressed by the Chinese government, well, totalitarian communist government approved culture isn't really what the West is clamoring for. 

Meanwhile, it seems like every Chinese family with the resources to do so is sending their kids and money to the U.S., Canada, or Australia, which isn't really an optimistic sign. 

Then add the fact that the U.S. is the reserve currency for the world. Backed by the largest economy and the strongest government in the world, it's more stable than most of the other world currencies. China and Russia may want to team up on an economic union not backed by the dollar, but with a [ruble chart that looks like this](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RUBUSD%3DX+Interactive#), China's probably going to keep buying U.S. debt instead.

This is true but generally in many of the sciences people generally have to have a PhD to get employed in their field.

The notable exceptions are some engineering disciplines and computing/computer science.

Also, people should be aware that free trade principles and the global trade game will likely change a lot of norms in the years to come quite possibly decreasing the entry level options of people in the developed countries that are WTO members and/or signatories to free trade agreements like TISA (and/or TPP/TTIP). 

Essentially the developed countries are keen to trade some jobs - possibly a lot of jobs, for access to rapidly growing markets in the developing world. 

This would occur under something called ""Mode Four"" of international trade in services.

The sarcastic answer is:  about half way through, where we've always been.

With respect to the 2008/2009 onset of the GFC, the debt in question (shill mortgage debt) was sequestered into the central bank equivalent of ""special purpose vehicles (an Enron term)"" (Resolution Trust Corporations) that prevented all of the investment banks from going seriously tango uniform.  The FedResInk is still trying to figure out how to get all that shit off its books... you know; safe as houses; those mortgages were backed by real collateral (just not as valuable as presented on the balance sheet); meanwhile, unoccupied homes get the copper stripped out of them, making them worthless as assets while property taxes accumulate.  But it's OK... Wall St. figures the best way to recoup that money (that wasn't destroyed through bank failure) is to turn us all into renters... and thus out of the RTCs, houses have streamed into investment companies like Black Rock, who wants to turn all those shill debtors into honest hard working renters.

> where is North America currently in the [...] short term debt cycle

Well, the average consumer is in a period of forced deleveraging and everyone is doing their best to pay off debt, especially consumer debt.  On the flip side, if you're 50 or older and have been unemployed for more than 3 months, you're unofficially retired.  It takes a couple of years before they find this out (2 years on unemployment benefits?  longer?), but once they do, they're forced to scavenge anything they can out of any residual value in their homes, 401ks or IRAs.  Hopefully they'll make it to social security retirement age.  Is that debt?  When you stop earning before you are officially retired, is that debt?  I think so.  It's just not balance sheet debt, so who cares... they're still consumers who are spending into the economy.

> where is North America currently in the long term [...] debt cycle?

Define ""America"".  The government is up to its snout in debt issuance and the FedResInk is buying most of its debt.  Corporate debt is at an all time high, but that's because of ZIRP; if you can make 2% on free money, guess what?... you've just make 1% absolutely risk free... how much of it can you handle, the FedResInk asks as they hand you more.  More abstractly, other long term debt is in the process of being ""renegotiated"" (another name for ""hair cut"" or ""default"").... that started with the GM bankruptcy.  Basically everyone with a defined pension got told to fuck off.  [then Stockton and Detroit and San Bernardino and so on](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/municipal-cities-counties-bankruptcies-and-defaults.html).  The only thing that has kept municipal defaults off the radar is only about half the states allow municipalities to default, but [the vast majority of municipal debt holders (75%) are individuals and their retirement savings as represented in mutual funds.](http://libertystreeteconomics.typepad.com/.a/6a01348793456c970c016306449140970d-popup).  All said and done, it's a couple of trillion dollars on the line (maybe 20% of the GDP).  And then there's student debt.  And then there's obligations for future entitlements.   And then theres the IOUs held by social security (this is separate from future entitlements).  And then there's all those foreign held treasuries that could come rushing back in.  And on and on and on.  That's the bad part about being the oil trade's reserve currency and making up about half of the transactional medium for world trade.  You can get away with bloody fucking murder when it comes to keeping the ""household checkbook"" in order.

Oh, hell no.  We're just getting started.  All you have to do is take a look at the St. Louis Fed's graphs to understand that the 2009 GFC kicked off a much grander, far larger era of debt issuance.  And we're not the only ones.  The GFC is called ""Global"", not because the US was the world's reserve currency; it's call ""Global"" because everyone else was fucking doing it... and just like the US, everyone is issuing even more debt to paper over what should have been massive bank failures and sovereign default.

1) Greece has an annual primary surplus. Quarterly, it loses money in Q1 and Q4. Thus, it still needs the ability to take out short-term loans.

2) Some of the debt is owned by Greek banks and non-banks. Even if they choose to not pay the Troika, they still have to worry about those they've borrowed within Greece.  And remember, they have no money.

3) Greeks have been pulling their money out of Greek banks at about 500 million euros a month, and to cover this gap the ECB has been injecting Greek banks with cash.  If Greece goes bankrupt, the ECB has to stop injecting Greek banks with cash. Meaning, the Greek government would have to plug the gap, or their banking system collapses. Again, Greece has no extra cash.

4) The eurozone gives Greece free money through grants to work on projects. If they go bankrupt, much of this money stop entering Greece. This is a small point, but it will reduce the country's GDP a bit...",2,1432316143.0

The dual mandate does not dictate policy regarding inequality, and frankly it is well outside the realm of that which the bank has the time, resources or capabilities to concern itself with.  IMO discussions around wealth inequality is well within the role of the government and our elected officials, but does not have a place within policy at the Fed.

Further, you are making an argument that the Fed's response to the 2008 crisis actually fueled income inequality, but I think the opposite could be just as easily argued.  The Fed acted well within its mandate to target a method of balancing unemployment and price stability, and while the gamble was certainly new I think it could be argued that generally it did smooth some of the impacts that could have been felt at the time.

Had the Fed allowed for a full market correction, we are likely talking about a full economic meltdown the likes of which have possibly never been seen.  Rampant unemployment beyond what we actually saw, liquidity would have been a mess within as well as outside the financial services sector, and credit would have been completely non-existent.

While you argue that the Fed essentially just ""propped up"" equities and that, by definition, this helps exclusively the wealthy, I would disagree with both of those premises.  I'm not sure you are considering all the longer range impacts to the lower middle and middle class.  Consider middle class union members and others on a pension, and the impact such a drop has on those pension assets.  Consider middle class individuals who are dependent on disability or long term care insurance and the impact a bottoming out of equities would have on companies providing that coverage.  Consider the long range impact to 401(k)s beyond the dip that people experienced at that time.  The impacts, had equities not been supported, certainly find their way to the middle class - and in some sense the net impact to those individuals may have been more devastating.

I think you might be able to make a long argument that had the market cleared, we may have come out the other side with the economy somewhat more stable, and I think a number of economic thinkers have argued that, but it's really impossible to know.  The severity of the instability, unemployment, and lack of credit that would have been experienced, and over a longer duration than we did, make it so difficult to predict because I don't know that we have really experienced that before or since.

This is not how economies work.  We all work for each other.  More people working creates more output for people to consume.  

Think of a microcosm of two primitive families.  If both fathers go hunting, and the wives watch their kids, you get two hunters worth of food.  If one mother watches both families kids and the other farms, you get two hunters and a farmer worth of food.  More people in the workforce doesn't reduce pay, it increases production and raises quality of life.  

In modern terms we should be living better, being able to afford having more done for us, more time spent delivering services to us than we used to because women work and in some ways, particularly healthcare, this is the case but overall, the real value of pay is eroding, and we are able to afford a lot fewer services than we used to.  Efficiency increases have done a lot to mask the true extent of this.  We can still live reasonably well on the little time we can afford to purchase from others because it buys so much more than it used to.

> families aren't twice as wealthy now that the women work instead of the majority of workers being men 

This is absolutely true, and why people should be a lot more mad about the current state of the economy than we are.  It's embarrassingly hard to live on a single decent income and we have a government that's incapable of doing anything but shielding itself from blame.  Our productivity is higher than it's ever been, and it should be easier than ever to make ends meet, but it's not.  

Capitalism, when functioning properly, does amazing things for the consumer/worker. Profits are supposed to be squeezed from two sides making companies have to work hard to stay alive.  They are supposed to have to fight to keep their demand from being eroded by competitors taking customers, and they are supposed to have to fight to keep their supply from being eroded by competitors taking employees. This keeps pay high, prices and profits low and the economy efficient.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where companies practice strategic competition reduction through a huge array of anti-competitive behaviors, state sanctioned monopolies including patents and copyrighted software, and investing in capital assets that give them competitive advantages. These all drive competition down and drive a wedge between what the company can earn and what they must pay, pusing profits up.  This is why the rich are getting richer, and the workforce is getting poorer.  Without a government doing it's job and keeping capitalism functioning the way it's supposed to, things will only get worse.

My preferred counter to this is to [tax everything they use to gain a competitive advantage](http://dugen.blogspot.com/2015/05/tax-owners-not-workers-v2.html) forcing those extracting profit from an economy to share that profit with the people of that economy, but I seem to be the only person who thinks this way so its rather unlikely to happen.  it's safe to assume things will get worse before they get better.

t3_39vooi,cs79rzs,"Edit:misread OP, and am on my phone. Replace 2.19 with 219

Capital owners paid 2.19 billion dollars in labor costs during period 0.

In period 1, they pay somewhere between the discounted present value of 2.19 billion per year forever, and the cost of the technology to adopt the technology. Let's pretend it gets negotiated to precisely 2.19 billion. 

GDP is in no way lowered by this, as the same amount of value was produced. Now, that 2.19 billion is likely being taxed far, far less in period 1, since instead of being taxed at personal income rates, the capital owners just got a 2.19 billion deduction, and the profits to the companies that are likely not taxed highly enough to compensate. 

The capital owners margins go up immediately. Profits go up quickly. As transportation becomes more profitable, transportation opportunities previously discarded are now explored, and more transportation happens, likely at somewhat decreased prices.

Laborers collect government benefits at an increased rate. They spend less than they did before. The goods & services they consume with money from government transfer payments, plus the zero-sum nature of them being replaced by capital goods, almost guarantees that GDP will be higher in period 1 than period 0.

Going into period 2, when actors have had time to adjust to what happened, things get murkier:

First, the government will have to come up with some response to the likely increase in the deficit from period one. 

Second, all sorts of businesses will have to respond to the change in the transportation industry. There are obvious, simple consequences (the price of most consumer goods will have to be adjusted) and very complicated unforeseeable changes (how will this effect the concept of a bar crawl? What companies will arise to create new products to assist those undertaking this new genre of bar crawl adventure?). It's likely this will cause a wide array of new opportunities. 

Workers, in the US at least, will eventually go off of benefits programs (because you can only collect for a short time by law. This is in no way a commentary on how long different nationalities will wait before seriously looking for work). What they'll then do is very uncertain. Likely, they will drive down wages in fields with related skill sets, increasing profits in those sectors, increasing the amount produced in those sectors, and reducing the prices in those sectors. E.g. If long haul trucking and being a security guard have related skill sets, we would expect a decline in the wages of security guards, an increase in the profits of private security firms, and more security to be done for lower cost.

Likely, there would be a substantial structural skills gap, and unemployment would be persistently higher for several years. Labor's total share of income would be expected to go down, and certain sorts of consumer goods would face decreased demand. However, this isn't neccessarily the case: it's possible that the technology shift could create a huge number of new jobs with skills the labor market is already prepared for - e.g. perhaps longhaul truckers have the precise skillset required to work as drone truck supervisors, fleet repair crews, and to run & operate innovative companies that exploit new opportunities created by this technology. 

Period 3, the real long term, is all upside. Workers have adjusted their skills and are doing useful stuff, that 2.19 billion and more is being used by the transportation companies, goods are cheaper, more numerous, and where they need to be quicker, and entire new businesses have been created to exploit the new opportunities.

Because the reason for all the drum banging and hollering out of Brussels is that the effects on Europe are far scarier than the effects on Greece.

Greece is already a debt colony.  A default arguably frees them of billions in payments, at the expense of near-term financial chaos.   The argument that the Greek economy would never recover is patently silly.  A new drachma would certainly have massive inflation problems, but not as badly as Brussels pretends.  Additionally, Russia and China stand at the ready with new loans on a clean-slate.  Most importantly, Greece gains control of it's monetary policy -- which is the core of sovereignty.  (It's the reason the UK gave the Euro the finger. You can't be a sovereign nation without control of your monetary policy).

Europe on the other hand would suffer epic damage as some of their biggest financial institutions implode.  Additionally, the potential for an Italy, Spain, Portugal chain reaction is not non-zero.  Lastly, a real risk to Europe is in giving Russia and China a massive foothold on the Mediterranean.  The strategic risk to Europe is rarely discussed -- and huge.

But Greece joined the Euro anyway, basically faking the whole responsibility thing. Some of this faking was well done, but a lot of it was pretty transparent. Anyone who lent to Greece should have known that the Greek government was a bad risk and demanded high interest. But for a while Greece was borrowing at almost the same interest rate as Germany (which actually is responsible, to a fault), which was just nuts.

When things went south after the financial crash, everyone suddenly saw how stupid those loans had been. Or, if you're Eurozone central bankers, how improvident and inept Greece had been. 

Really both are true, but the central bankers, rather than acknowledging that the crash itself--which, remember, they'd said was impossible--showed that they also didn't know what they were doing, decided to ""bail out"" Greece--which is to say, trade good money to Greece's creditors in exchange for Greece's bad debt.

In exchange even for this help, Greece had to impose austerity. In other words, although it takes two to make a bad loan, the Greeks were expected to bear pretty much all the pain while the banks got their money back.

But while austerity makes sense for a household--if you're in debt, cut your spending, because duh--it doesn't make sense for a country. When a government cuts its spending, that spending is income for other people, that income becomes tax revenue, and so on. So if you cut spending, you cut the national income, and there's less economy to pay back the debt from. So although the Greek government spends less than it used to, it spends more as a % of the shrunken Greek GDP.

Leading to a new crisis, more bailouts, more austerity, and so on. 

That's been the pattern since. The ""no"" vote was the Greek people saying, enough of this bullshit.",2,1436283255.0

t3_3eni81,ctguza6,"Answers to your questions: 1) Not necessarily, however, previous studies show a slight decrease. 2) More or less, yes. Cost-push inflation is one of the means by which it may increase. 3) Most likely no, one exception is through the scale effect; a lot of it will depend on how low-wage workers will impact the job market. 4) Both in the short term and long term, job growth is uncertain--typically a decline or no change has been shown in previous studies. 5) Most likely, yes. See the scale and substitution effects passage for an analogous situation of how that could happen. 6) Depends on the workforce of the small business; their costs will go up if they hire a greater proportion of low-wage workers 7) Did not fully address social welfare programs, but it's possible that there may be no change, see the wage inequality section. 8) Depends what you mean by a ""large amount,"" but not to this scale. A difference-in-differences estimation has been provided comparing states that implemented an increase in minimum wage or stayed the same, finding small to no effects on employment. You could find similar studies. 

To simplify, you're looking for the effects of an increase in minimum wage on inequality, prices, skilled labor and total employment, substitutes of labor (e.g., capital/automation), different industries, and social insurance programs. I am unable to address all of the topics, but I'll share what's in my labor economics textbook *Modern Labor Economics* by Ronald Ehrenberg and Robert Smith (108-

When it was initially set by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA, 1938), the minimum wage was at $.25. Historically, changes have been gradual, with the recent change taking place in 2007. As the current minimum wage is $7.25, it still only covers ""40% of the average manufacturing wage"" (109). Here are some of those topics covered mostly from a theoretical viewpoint:

1. Effects on employment: Basic labor economics theory dictates that when wages increase, the level of employment should decline holding other factors constant. This idea has an intuitive approach, as well, because the cost of production goes up given that labor is an input to production, so you choose to hire fewer workers. The effects can be greater for the low-skilled work who could be displaced in favor of capital, higher-skilled workers, etc. and in areas with the lowest costs of living. ""In a growing
economy, then, the expected effect of a one-time increase in the minimum wage is to reduce the rate of growth of employment"" (111). Now if there are sectors in the market that are uncovered, not fully affected by the minimum wage, employment maybe rearranged such that certain workers will move toward those sectors and for these areas wages will go down (think of it as supply of labor increases, wages decrease), yet ""wait employment"" or individuals looking to transfer into these sectors who may wait and be temporarily unemployed may occur, resulting in lower levels of employment. One of the exceptions to this can be described through the scale effect.

2. Scale and substitution effects: Directly taken: ""Substitution effects stem from changes in how firms choose to produce, while scale effects are rooted in consumer adjustments to changes in product prices"" (113). In terms of minimum wage, some businesses have a larger share of costs that are associated with low-wage labor, and as the minimum wage goes up, so do these costs. This will reflect an increase in their product prices, and consumers may be directed toward other businesses where such costs are not as significant which could then lead to an increase demand for workers--i.e., total effect on employment: ambiguous. Moreover, a historical analysis of minimum wage on the transition from manual to automotive production: ""Before the passage of the minimum wage, there had been a slow movement from the use of handtransfer to converted-transfer knitting machines.
(A converted-transfer machine had an attachment
to enable automated production for certain types of
work.) The minimum wage seems to have accelerated
this trend. In the first two years of the law’s existence,
there was a 23 percent decrease in the
number of hand-transfer machines, a 69 percent increase
in converted-transfer machines, and a 10 percent
increase in fully automatic machines"" (114, Data from: Andrew J. Seltzer, “The Effects of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938). ""Perhaps the most that can be said generally is that
unskilled labor and capital are more likely to be substitutes in production than are skilled labor and capital, which some studies have identified as complements in
production. Because factors of production that are complementary must be gross complements, technological change is more likely to increase the demand for skilled than for unskilled labor"" (118). 

2. Brief mention on earnings and wages: ""aggregate earnings of low-wage workers could be made smaller by an increase in minimum wage,"" but real wages may continue to fluctuate based on inflation.

3. With regards to areas of coverage or respective industries, ""Coverage (of minimum) has increased over the years, but the law still does not apply to some nonsupervisory workers (mainly those in small firms in the retail trade and service industries). Also, with millions of employers and limited resources for governmental enforcement, noncompliance with the law may be widespread, creating another kind of noncoverage"" (citing in the footnotes Orley Ashenfelter and Robert Smith, 1979). ""Widely reviewed and replicated studies of employment changes in the fastfood (sic)
industry, for example, disagree on whether employment was affected at all by minimum wage increases in the early 1990s"" (113, see Neumark and Wascher “Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Comment,” and David Card and Alan B. Krueger, “Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Reply"").

5. On wage inequality: A study by David Neumark, Mark Schweitzer, and William Wascher, “The Effects of Minimum Wages Throughout the Wage Distribution,"" describes that less than 10% in the lowest income group benefited from the increase in minimum wage during 1990-1991. The effects, as stated,  are partly based on low levels of employment or wages are above the minimum. ""50 percent of the increases went to families whose incomes were at least twice the poverty level"" (115). 

tl;dr No clear answer on how minimum wage affects employment (typically small effects or it reduces employment). Costs will rise putting an upward pressure on prices; whereas, previous studies show that firms will substitute for labor when there are improvements in technology.",11,1437933886.0

My understanding is that raising the minimum wage would definitely combat wealth inequality - however, jumping from a 7.25 federal minimum wage to 15 that quickly may have repercussions. Inflation would increase as well. 

The think about economics and theory is that, usually, economic actions has trade offs. Raising the minimum wage would probably lead to some trade off that some people are okay living with (pro higher wage) or other people think would be bad for the economy (anti higher wage/minimum wage). 

Personally I am for it. I think wealth inequality is a huge issue and I see raising the minimum wage as a way to address it. I wouldn't mind the increases in inflation because, from the studies I have seen, wages would outpace inflation. ",7,1437918695.0

t3_3goxjj,cu0595u,"Most major currencies are openly traded on the market. Their relative value will go up and down depending on how many buyers and sellers there are, and what they are willing to pay.

The Yuan is traded on some international markets, but within China, the government controls the amount of currency you can buy and sell (as well as transfer in and out of the country), and the price you can pay for it.

The rest of the world has been on China's case for years to get them to float the currency on the market, but the government still hasn't done that. For a long time, other countries, particularly the US, claimed that the value of the Yuan was too low, amounting to an artificial subsidy for Chinese exports (more on that later). 

Several years ago, China began what they call ""limited floating"" of the Yuan. Basically, the central bank allows the price to go up and down, but on any given day, it is only allowed to fluctuate a very small amount within a window set by the government. So basically, it can go up and down a bit, but it's still not really floating on the market like other major currencies.

Analysts point to two reasons for the recent devaluation. First, the international market price for the Yuan has recently been lower than the official Chinese trading price. This move brings it closer to the ""actual"" market value for the currency. Second, China's economy has been under a lot of pressure lately, with falling stock prices and stagnating exports.

When the value of a currency goes down, the temporary effect is for a nation's export goods to become cheaper. Workers in China don't base their salary expectations on the relative values of international currencies, but on how much it costs to live in local prices. Likewise, most local goods are bought and sold in the local currency. (As an aside--it has cost 1 Yuan for a cheap disposable lighter for as long as I've been here-fifteen years). If the value of the currency drops, then for a while, your costs are suddenly lower in international terms, and you can sell your products for less than your neighbors do.

This effect is eventually diminished by inflation, the need to pay for things on the international market, and (usually) by currency traders trying to make a buck. But in the short term, it usually helps.",15,1439363881.0

But it often happens that banks are caught committing fraud and only get a slap on the wrist.

There are a couple reasons:

The government employees who investigate financial institutions, such as the SEC, are not paid enough. So many SEC employees hope to get a profitable job with banks after they leave the government. This means they are scared of making banks angry.

The SEC and related agencies are not given enough funding to do the large scale, expensive lawsuits necessary to beat the banks in a trial.

The SEC and related agencies are discouraged from being too aggressive. Banks have a lot of political power. And a lot of politicians think the government is already too big and powerful. So the SEC keeps a low profile. 

All these factors result in a situation where nobody in the US government actually wants to go to trial against the banks, even when they have been caught red-handed. So they agree to very, very weak settlement agreements in order to avoid trial. ",13,1440005056.0

An economy requires people producing things. So you need entrepreneurs to build productive businesses. The more businesses being productive the better the economy.

If most your population is already working and being productive, then to improve it you need to be more efficient at your business. If each business can use some innovation to do twice the work, better economy. 

You can also have businesses produce things that are more valuable. So instead of having agriculture businesses, building oil refineries would be a more efficient use of manpower since oil is so useful and would thus lead to a stronger economy.

Therefore to grow an economy you want people who can make businesses, you want them to be educated to make efficient businesses, and you want them to be producing useful things.

So from what I understand, the best the government can do is have regulations that promote business, fund business startups, have solid education to promote smart people to make efficient businesses, and have access to resources that can be efficiently gathered.

Those statistics that show how much more people have earned over a 40 year career.. they're all based on the reality of the last 40 years of the job market, not the next 40 years.  They're based on a selective college system of 40 years ago that only accepted the best and the brightest and a private industry that needed those people. 

Today we have a college system which will pretty much let anyone attend who wants to pay for the privilege.  It's not selective.  The value in a degree used to be that an employer could know that if you had a degree you were 

  * smart (degree programs were selective)
  * financially stable (college was expensive and optional)
  * able to resist temptation (college life was full of parties and drugs and ways to flunk out)
  * self motivated (able to continue to study even when living away from parents)

Notice that none of that speaks to what you actually learned in college, which was largely unimportant.  Now, thanks to the modern online degree programs, we've boiled things down to contain only the education, which was the least important part of college.  None of this is ensured anymore.  

The statistics are also horribly skewed by the fact that degree programs classically only let in the people with the most earning potential.  If I picked the best and brightest high school students, handed them all a button, and then showed you statistics that showed those people earned twice as much as the others, would you believe the button doubled their pay?  This is what these statistics do.  They lie, using facts.  

Do not, under any circumstances, assume that going to college is right for everyone.  It's not.  You have to look at *your* life, *your* situation, and *your* career goals to decide if it's right for you.  The truth is, that now, just like at every point in history, college is the wrong choice for most people.  Most jobs don't need a degree, and for people working those jobs, a degree is a waste.

Where it can become a problem is if people lose confidence for some reason or another and as debt comes due it needs to be reissued at higher interest rates.  Whatever caused the confidence shake in the first place will be some sort of event (be it a financial crisis or a war or simply issuing too much debt and looking fiscally irresposible) that also requires funding and suddenly you find yourself in a situation where you are issuing debt that you can't service without really turning the inflation up.

Exactly.  Which is appropriate since the system *isn't* fair. 

We have a system rigged in favor of the rich (and by that I mean the real definition of rich, not people whose work is valuable.)  The labor share of GDP is [dropping consistently and globally](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/brent.neiman/research/KN.pdf), which is apparently not supposed to happen.   We have copyright laws that were designed to compensate authors for writing books being used to enable monopoly rent to be collected from every company that uses software, and rent breaks capitalism.  We have patents that were designed to enable inventors to compete with established companies, being used by established companies to prevent exactly that.  We have bankers betting with their depositors money and wanting to keep their winnings, and get taxpayer bailouts when they lose.  This all adds up to a system where having money is overvalued and doing work is undervalued.  Capitalism isn't a self-regulating system.  It requires constant adjustment, forcing companies to compete fairly and not cheat the system, but we have been convinced to abandon our posts and let the inmates run the asylum and what we've gotten is a system that isn't just unfair, it's broken to the point of near collapse.

For someone to have a trillion dollars in their bank account, there must exist a trillion in debt out in the economy somewhere.  The more money the rich have, the poorer the rest of us must be. 

However, the rich don't *really* have their wealth stored in money in the bank.  While some of it is in banks, and some is in other ways to sell us debt like mortgages and treasury bonds, most of their wealth is in capital assets that are worth money.  The problem with seeing that as all that much different is that the monetary value of capital assets is based on their ability to pull money out of an economy.  That money is coming from the working population, so the more those assets are worth, the more they're earning from the rest of us and the less of the money that we spend goes to labor.  There is no way for the rich to get richer without it being at the expense of the rest of us.  

If you think about it though, that's obvious.  Having money means being able to purchase the output of labor.   The rich having money literally means the rest of us owe them.  If that weren't the case, being rich would be meaningless. 

I'd also like to point out that the rich *having* money is not a problem.  That's normal, and we all want to maintain that dynamic.  The rich earning lots of money *because* they are rich is the problem.  That's indicitive of a system that's not fair to the rest of us. ",8,1447021705.0

When held it can become a choke point for an economy: The wealthy can literally, actually, factually *choke an economy to death* by doing this.

t3_3xkys2,cy5ixbb,"This would mean people gained exactly the same income (for all practical purposes, of course)...",5,1450625855.0
t3_3xkys2,cy5swrf,"On the one hand, this gives everybody the same absolute purchasing power, but it also means that everybody wants to sell their goods to the richest people (assuming that people see some value in money, which will be dependent on whether there is anything to be bought whose price isn't tied to the buyer's income).  

So if there isn't a black market, everybody is now equal, and the system would be equivalent to either a system of rationing or a system where everybody have exactly the same income.

However, if there is a black market, things get much more complicated.  If there is an incentive to earn more money, then no merchant in the regular market will want to sell to poor people, and so (1) goods with limited numbers will be purchased only by the rich, and (2) plentiful goods will not sold to people so poor that their purchase price does not cover the cost of manufacturing the good, unless there some law requiring them to do so.

The black market is where things get more interesting.  Since the poor cannot buy necessities like food on the regular market, they are forced to turn to the black market, where prices are higher (as a percentage of their income) than they would pay otherwise if they were actually able to make purchases in the regular market.  However, the exist of fixed price goods means that all the mega-wealthy make HUGE savings by buying food off of the black market.  This means that prices on the black market will rise. This will do two things.  First, it will raise the cutoff that regular merchants are selling their goods for (first you don't sell to the poor because they are costing you money, but then you don't sell to the lower middle class because you could make more money selling on the black market).  Second, it creates arbitrage opportunities.  Any person poor enough to get good deals in the regular economy but not so poor that they are shut out of the regular economy can make good money by buying at regular stores and reselling on the black market.

So for every plentiful good, the poor will have to buy on the black market, the rich will choose to buy on the black market.  And what will happen for the less-plentiful goods, the luxury items that will only be sold to the rich?  Millionaires will be used as proxies for billionaires to purchase these items, making a tidy profit  for their service.  In essence, there will be a luxury-goods-specific black market, organized by the rich, catering to the super rich.  However, over time, luxury merchants will choose to sell exclusively on the black market because no billionaire will choose to buy a Rolex for 1% of his income when he can just buy one for $10,000 from the black market.

**tl;dr.**Unless there are laws in place to prevent it, a huge black market will pop up, and almost all economic transactions will happen there instead of the normal market.  ",4,1450643754.0

Countries that mainly consume oil products will see gain. This will also hurt those countries that have switched significantly to alternative energies because they won't be able to take as much advantage of the economic benefit of cheaper oil.

Because demand side subsidization of the health care industry primarily by Medicare and Medicaid continues full force and supplemented significantly by the Medicaid expansion of Obaacare, health care prices will continue to skyrocket which will squeeze health insurance companies who will find it increasingly unprofitable to stay in business. This in turn will impact the ability of people to get health care in the form of increasing deductibles and/or monthly payments.

Most companies were cash-flow negative even with oil at >$100/barrel and were being funded by debt and investment.

In terms of the oil supply sharply falling if those companies fail, that's unlikely. While tight shale wells have a rapid production decline, they eventually stabilize at a low output for years. Because thousands of these have been drilled in the last five years, the enormous number of mature wells cushions the falloff of new wells, so the decline will be gradual.

In terms of production ending as leaseholders go bankrupt, I don't think that's likely. Someone will end up owning the lease, and simply collecting the oil is profitable.

Roughly, the two peak ranges are in the 20-24 and 50-54 categories. There's a large generation of people set up to retire, followed by an even larger generation currently looking for jobs. With the avg. retirement age sitting around 62, there is a lag in the openings for work, as we wait for the boomers to retire. As well, the improvement in automation technologies has swept up jobs, if not already being outsourced to developing nations. This leaves a very different (diminished) opportunity for people to find a career, or even a basic job.

1. The higher the minimum wage is, the more people become unemployed, for those people who are earning below the minimum wage, because the employer gains less from their labor than they're paying (the minimum wage). 

2. The more people currently earn below a new minimum wage, the greater the impact it will have. Hence you can have both studies that say it seems to have no effect on employment or that have a strong effect on employment.

3. The more people become unemployed, the harder it will be to get a new job and the more desperate they will be to find a new job.

4. The more people's incomes increase due to the new minimum wage, the more they will be able to save for the times when they're not employed. 

5. The more people become unemployed as a result of this, the more of their time will be converted from labor to leisure, which is also valuable and is to be treasured; but it does mean less goods and services are produced (because of overall lower labor).

6. This leisure time includes things like opportunities to learn a new skill, start freelancing, found a company, etc. which can help them get a better job later.

7. The higher the minimum wage, the more employers have to pay their lower-wage employees, which cuts down into their profits. To the extent they can, they will opt to move overseas or find technological solutions to make their remaining workers more productive. 

8. The more that lower-wage people get a higher wage, the more this causes people earning above them to clamor for even higher wages, and this goes all the way up the wage ladder.

9. The higher wages the employer pays may result in higher costs for products, but only for certain products where there's not a lot of competition. The higher wages will also stiffen market competition.

10. Also understand that only a small portion of the value of goods and services are value added by minimum wage workers (interest, fixed costs and input costs are far bigger portions of the value/cost), so say a 10% increase in US wages may increase the cost of goods by only say 1%.

11. Progressives believe people deserve higher wages / higher standard of living, as such they are liable to understate the unemployment effect, in order to persuade people to support a higher minimum wage.

12. Employers want to pay people lower wages, as such they have an incentive to overstate the unemployment effect, in order to persuade people to abolish the minimum wage.

13. There are also people who believe the narrative promulgated by the moneyed class that 'minimum wages kill jobs', so they will disfavor minimum wages even if doing so hurts their own economic interests. 

14. At the end of the day, jobs are not a 'good thing', but a solution to a pair of problems: 1) how to get stuff produced and 2) how to ensure people have the ability to get what they need; both of which can eventually be solved via other means (such as automation + universal basic income).

15. The money for the increased minimum wage comes from employers, who have to get it from goods and services sold. Since a minimum wage doesn't result in printing of more money, nor does it cause money to circulate faster, it won't cause inflation.

16. It takes employers time to adjust to increases in the minimum wage. They have fixed costs (such as mortgage on the store and interest on loans) which they can't get out of perhaps for years. This may result in a situation where the employer is losing money but won't close up shop or downsize because doing so would result in an even larger monetary loss; and so won't fire anyone.

t3_49n5a3,d0t6q2f,"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/why-is-deflation-bad/

A number of readers have asked me to explain why deflation is a bad thing; and the truth is that while I’ve alluded to the issue a number of times, I’m not sure if I’ve ever laid out the whole case. So here goes.

There are actually three different reasons to worry about deflation, two on the demand side and one on the supply side.

So first of all: when people expect falling prices, they become less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borrow. After all, when prices are falling, just sitting on cash becomes an investment with a positive real yield – Japanese bank deposits are a really good deal compared with those in America — and anyone considering borrowing, even for a productive investment, has to take account of the fact that the loan will have to repaid in dollars that are worth more than the dollars you borrowed. If the economy is doing well, all this can be offset by just keeping interest rates low; but if the economy isn’t doing well, even a zero rate may not be low enough to achieve full employment.

And when that happens, the economy may stay depressed because people expect deflation, and deflation may continue because the economy remains depressed. That’s the deflationary trap we keep worrying about.

A second effect: even aside from expectations of future deflation, falling prices worsen the position of debtors, by increasing the real burden of their debts. Now, you might think this is a zero-sum affair, since creditors experience a corresponding gain. But as Irving Fisher pointed out long ago (pdf), debtors are likely to be forced to cut their spending when their debt burden rises, while creditors aren’t likely to increase their spending by the same amount. So deflation exerts a depressing effect on spending by raising debt burdens – which, as Fisher also points out, can lead to another kind of vicious circle, in which depressed spending because of rising real debt leads to further deflation.

Finally, in a deflationary economy, wages as well as prices often have to fall – and it’s a fact of life that it’s very hard to cut nominal wages — there’s downward nominal wage rigidity. What this means is that in general economies don’t manage to have falling wages unless they also have mass unemployment, so that workers are desperate enough to accept those wage declines. See Estonia and Latvia, cases of.

Now, alert readers will have noticed that none of these arguments abruptly kicks in when the inflation rate goes from +0.1% to -0.1%. Even with low but positive inflation the zero lower bound may be binding; inflation that comes in lower than borrowers expected leaves them with a worse debt burden than they were counting on, even if the inflation is positive; and since relative wages are shifting around all the time, some nominal wages will have to fall even if the overall rate of inflation is a bit above zero. So the argument that deflation is a bad thing is also an argument saying that some economic problems get worse as inflation falls, and that too low an inflation rate may actually be economically damaging. That’s why the fact that inflation, while still positive, is below the Fed’s target is bad news; and it’s why respectable people like Olivier Blanchard (pdf) have suggested that a higher target, something like 4 percent inflation, might make sense.

And no, 4 percent inflation wouldn’t turn us into Zimbabwe. I remember when we had stable inflation of around 4 percent – and it was morning in America.",16,1457513589.0

t3_4cb8fm,d1gvhxg,"Lemme try to explain the best I can without turning it into a political battle. There is a massive amount of conflicting thought processes and evidence around this issue and it is largely dependent on your viewpoint. 

Proponents on the $15/Hour side would say that their current wages are not high enough at 40 hours a week to support their family. In that same thought, minimum wage work like fast food/retail was never designed to be career level wages but much research has come out to say that many family providers are in these jobs and I don't imagine it is easy to raise a family on 20-28K a year. This also brings up a second point which I would consider the more important factor which is velocity of money (which is how fast money is moving from one transaction to another; e.g. getting paid, buying groceries, grocer paying employees and suppliers, etc..). This number has been steadily decreasing on average since 1997. The best way to understand this concept in relation to minimum wage is that a person making minimum wage will spend around 100% of their income which increases the velocity of money; while on the other end, the business owner/rich people will spend a much lower percentage of their income (think 5-10%) and the rest will go into savings and investments that are non contributing to economic activity. The general theory from this would be that if low-skill workers were paid more than they would spend more and it would increase overall economic activity and because minimum wage jobs are paying more than people in mid-skill jobs would receive raises to compensate them for their higher skill.

Proponents against this would say that when you increase labor costs, prices must rise (e.g. Inflation). Hence ruining the increase in wages because goods and services would cost the same amount proportionally. With that thought train the economy would enter into higher rates of inflation which would end up leaving the minimum wage workers in the same position and would actually punish the savers because their savings accounts/Investments wouldn't be able to keep up with inflation. People on the other end of the spectrum would say that we want to business owners to earn less money from their businesses in exchange for their workers being paid more but unless you're just an altruistic business owner that's now how it would be. If I had employees and expected a 20% (random number) return on investment every year from the company I run and labor costs were to increase I would just increase my prices because as a business owner I expect a 20% return and would not just accept a 10% return because my labor costs went up. 

Now which one is right it a whole other issue which is why there is so much debate on the issue. Some studies have shown that an increases minimum wage does not cause the price inflation that would be expected. And other studies would show the opposite. If there was a clear answer there wouldn't be this debate.
tl;dr: Higher wages could cause an increase in velocity of money and increased consumer spending. Otherside would say this causes inflation and is pointless. ",2,1459201418.0

Before you hit that downvote button, hear me out.

Companies are essentially profit machines.  They take in money, and pay out taxes and dividends to shareholders.  Those shareholders pay taxes on their returns at the 20% capital gains rate rather than the 30-40% income rate.  Instead of taxing the companies, tax the shareholders when dividends are paid and at the full income rate.  Same goes for stock sales - tax those gains at full income as well.

This does a few things:

1.  Incentivise investment by allowing companies to bring home offshore cash and plow it into expanding their businesses.

2.  Raise employee salaries by same (edit: increasing tax revenue again)

3.  Encourage companies to set up shop here in the USA rather than overseas

Economically, there are very few arguments for even having a minimum wage. Everything we know about economics and about market dynamics tells us that fixing the price of any commodity, even labor, in the context of a free market, should never work out. 

And history is littered with failed attempts to fix the prices of grain, oil, metals, even currencies. The problem is that your fundamental free market forces immediately start to put pressure on something else when they can't put pressure on the thing that's being kept artificially high or low. 

For example, let's say grain is getting expensive and food costs are rising. In a totally free market food would just go up, some people would starve, until supply and demand forced equilibrium again. 

""Let people starve"" usually isn't politically popular so you fix the price of grain artificially low. 

Now farmers can't make enough money to stay running so they start going out of business. That's bad for everyone cos now you have a real supply problem. Which makes the original problem even worse. 

So you subsidize farmers to keep grain prices low. That costs money and increases the size of government and adds regulatory hassles - you see where I'm going with this. 

Economies are like those incredibly complex but pointless machines that do nothing. Move one part and everything else moves, sometimes in ways that you wouldn't expect from looking at the system. 

Labor economics is even more tricky because it's people and their lives and families you're talking about. 

So a balance between politically expedient, economically sound and ethically acceptable needs to be struck. And the shitty minimum wage system is what you're left with. 

It might suck but it's probably better than letting the labor market set its own prices. That works real well in places with no minimum wage, and it makes it SO much cheaper to make GAP clothes and iPhones there. ",5,1460485704.0

t3_4fb5zi,d289fkf,"Major reasons why the price of oil is currently low(comparatively to 2013): Global economic slump and a slight surplus in production versus consumption. Also oil is a commodity so there is a good deal of speculation mixed in with the price. Storage capacity plays a part as well but that is more mixed into speculation.

The reason SA wants to maintain a market share in this environment is that their oil reserves and production are easily maintained w/ low month to month production costs and production is easily manipulated. Unlike most of the world SA has bought into the idea of PEAK OIL CONSUMPTION. This meaning that at some point in the future the world will no longer consume as much oil daily as was previously consumed. There is debate on when this date will actually come, but if this holds true, which seems likely, the price of oil will never really recuperate, much like coal. So the idea for SA is to maintain as much market share in any price environment as long as the world has not reached the peak consumption, as the saudi's know that their production is the most cheaply produced in the world.

If you took a scenario in which some of the worst case propositions being presented actually occurred, then we'd be in a position where (according to Open Europe) UK GDP would be 2.2% lower in 2030 than if the UK had remained inside the EU.  That assumes that after leaving the EU the UK would not be able to negotiate any new agreement with the EU and would then fall back on World Trade Organization rules for trade.

That loss is based on the current projections, which put expected UK growth at around 2.4%/y, but of course it's over 14 years so averaged it'd be so it'd be a loss of around 0.2% a year. To put that into perspective, the 2008 crash caused a 2.5%(ish) reduction in GDP..

So even setting aside the numbers, using the worst case scenario that isn't WWIII, it's more about slower growth than recession. It's also worth thinking about the fact that that likely wouldn't be evenly spread (assume more of a loss initially, followed by less later).  Given a few years, the UK economy should be able to adapt either way, there is nothing fatal in the predictions or indeed generally, it is, based on the figures above, a question of lost growth (nothing to set aside lightly, but still).

The impact across the economy will be variable too, no-doubt there will be areas that see a benefit from the UK leaving the EU (not least the legal profession...), and other areas that will be hit harder.

I wouldn't worry too much about being fucked, that simply isn't being predicted by anyone... Less well off is about as far as it goes, and even then it involves projections out to 2030 on the back of scenarios that we simply don't have any evidence for yet.

It's the uncertainty that is going to cause short term pain, it will hit FDI, it will hit the currency and that'll get factored in to a lot of other areas, but once a decision has been made and the UK Government articulates a way forward (and negotiations are done..) we should see a return to relative stability. 

Remember that this doesn't change the fundamentals all that much, the biggest impact on the UK economy with or without the EU, outside of business decision making, will be domestic government policy anyway. and that has to (well... should..) take into account any change in circumstance.

t3_4pws08,d4ogq50,"You can look at FRED graphs to see that the USA is already in the middle of a large acceleration of printing money.  Currency wars cause competing nations to also engage in heavy money printing since no one country wants their currency to get highly valued, relative to other currencies, since that would hurt their export competitiveness.  So China, for example is also printing a shit ton.  If the economy enters recession, or a consensus is reached that we are in the middle of a global deleveraging, the likes of which we haven't seen since the 1930s, then I would wager that money printing will become even more noticeable and will accelerate a lot more.  There are only four ways, according to Ray Dalio, who heads the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater, to get out from under the global debt burden once it gets too large and the deleveraging begins: 1) debt defaults and restructuring (deflationary); aka. It becomes clear that the holders of debt, both people and institutions, can't repay it all and the creditors cut them a deal to accept less, and some debtors will completely default on their obligations, it's totally unfair to the creditor, but this does cause the debt to disappear... It's also probably the largest cause of violence and conflict when it happens on a global scale 2) austerity (deflationary); people and governments who have been spending more than they produce will have to learn to spend less than they produce until they pay off their debts 3) wealth reallocation, i.e. The laws of nations change in order to tax wealth and high income a lot more (inflationary); you can see this populist, workers movement already gaining strength... 50 years ago, would a ""socialist democrat"" like Bernie Sanders even stood a chance in American politics?  No, because 'during a boom time everyone is a capitalist, during a deleveraging, everyone is a socialist' 4) PRINT MONEY (inflationary).  The key to a ""beautiful"" deleveraging is balancing the deflationary measures with the inflationary ones so you avoid the kind of disasters that a run-away currency hyperinflation can cause (i.e. Venezuela's suffering right now is due to run away inflation... But because their leaders bet the whole country's economy on oil, which tanked... Aka a great example of why you as an individual and every nation as a whole really needs to diversify their assets to avoid suffering. Don't try to get rich quick and place all your eggs in one basket, just diversify and stay safe!  Easier said than done, due to greedy human nature). 

Anyway, there are private companies all around the world that provide the service of printing physical currency for a small (%) cost.  They will take orders from the governments/central banks (not sure which or if both) of the world and print them the currency to order and ship it to them.  Also, many of the world's nations' central banks own their own means of printing physical currency and are in charge of printing it, and not only to increase the money supply.

Inflation adjusted figures use CPI as the deflator, but CPI hasn't actually kept pace with many cost of living factors which all Americans must contend with in their lives, like the cost of healthcare, higher education and housing.  Gasoline prices have also whipsawed consumers in recent decades and that inflation has not been adequately reflected by CPI.

Simply stated, [widespread income/wage growth has lagged the true rate of inflation by a much wider margin than is publicly acknowledged](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-18/college-tuition-costs-soar-chart-of-the-day).

t3_4sct0c,d58bgbl,"U.B.I. has many problems. I had attended a Oxford debate on this subject and the against side won . I can tell you the arguments . 
 
First it is expensive , this expense is usually justified by cutting other social programs. So you cut targeted social programs to give everyone even rich people free money. Even if you only give it to people with low incomes there are plenty of people with low incomes that still have access to wealth , trust fund kids etc.  

Second is who will be paying that money .  The usual argument is that the ultra wealthy should be made to pay for it. The problem with that is that is that the ultra wealthy have a high mobility of they're wealth. So if you try to tax them to pay for a program like this and they don't want to pay for it they take they're money and leave. Then the burden falls back on the middle class and upper middle class and probably even more expensive because the program will require increased deficit spending increasing the debt burden of the government .  

Third is amount and inflation.  If you don't give enough for people to live on , then you have cut targeted social programs and left poor people with a deficit actually worse off then before.  

If you do give people enough to live on you create pressure on the bottom end of the wage scale plus everyone supplying basic necessities knows there is more money out there . That will create inflation, and perhaps very quickly but for sure inflation will eat the buying power of that money .  Then people will either end up back where they were or the benefit will have to be raised , further increasing inflation rinse wash repeat . 

One of the arguments for is that it removes the process of needs proving in social systems . Essentially some one who requires assistance ends up at the mercy of a bureaucrat who is likely not very accountable and can be petty and vindictive for all sorts of personal reasons .  

The thing is that you can essentially remove that anyways with existing programs  .  Things like drug testing and forcing people to turn in work searches have not proven to be very effective any ways . Offering people help with living expenses and job searching with out the persecution is just as effective or more effective. 

Lastly lets not forget about the risks. If your government spends too much money and can't pay it ends up like Greece , Detroit , or Puerto Rico . Privatization of resources and assets , no public services , and a hamstrung government that is being dictated terms by its creditors for the next decade or more.   ",4,1468268560.0

Those US corporations who moved to China are not being told by the Chinese gov what to produce and how much they can sell it for, so does that mean China is no longer a communist country?

And if you look at the most basic forms of capitalism and communism they are not that different from each other.  In a capitalist corporation you have a private owner/leader who decides what to produce, how much to produce, how much to sell it for and how much to pay the employees who work for him.

t3_4tqnk1,d5jgemn,"The only reason that makes sense to me is that the investors in these bonds are expecting yields to go even more negative and thus get price appreciation on the bond. Also, there are many institutions who must hold some portion of their investments in government debt regardless of yield. So they are price takers in the sense that they will continue to buy regardless of yield.

In the end, the yield is just an indicator of how your money grows over time assuming you reinvest all cashflows (yearly interest) at the same yield and you hold the bond to maturity. It could be that institutions who are bond buyers need to match against their liabilities down the line against interest paid by the bonds and aren't allowed to hold cash due to investment guidelines. 

But I know what you mean -- it's definitely hard to imagine why you'd want less cash later versus more cash now.

EDIT: Another reason might be the security you get by giving the government your money. In some countries, it might be less risky to give the government your money than putting it in a bank account where there's some credit risk of the bank going under.

Choice one was to let all the banks that created the loans/credit for the housing bubble to go bankrupt/collapse. 

Choice two was for the governments (not just US, multiple countries) to step in and loan money to all those banks so they could continue to function.

Obviously they decided on the second choice, so in order for this to happen money had to be created for the bailouts of the banks.  

Money is created by central/reserve banks around the world.  This is the balance sheet for the USA Federal Reserve Bank https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

You can see the huge spike in 2008, that is basically the FED creating money out of thin air, this money was given to the failing banks (by US gov/tax payers) so they could continue business as usual.

Some people like to make the argument that the bailouts were a loan to the banks and our gov was paid back with interest.  However if you look at the FED balance sheet we can clearly see it never comes back down after 2008, which means the FED never got the money back they created to bailout the banks.  Instead they continued to print more money with a program they called Quantitative Easing, which is the reason why the banks could actually pay back the loans.  So the US gov may have got their money back but the only reason the banks could pay back those loans is because the FED continued to create more money long after the bailouts.

Specifically -- Thailand didn't have nearly enough foreign FX reserves to keep its USD peg in place. They were forced to devalue and then... Boom.

t3_5741c3,d8oqp47,"Hope.

""Hope springs eternal""  ;)

But joking aside, the answer is **money**.

Money is a ""capital good"", which is a subset of economic goods. Money may seem scarce to the individual. But from a central bank perspective, money can be created in infinite quantities. (Look at Zimbabwe). 

Needless to say, you'll actually decrease the unit value of money by infinitely printing it and destroy your society with hyperinflation at some point -- but that's not the question here. 

The question *isn't* about the value of the note, or the sustainability of the greater economy. The question is about scarcity (or lack thereof) of an economic good in a quantitative sense. 

Therefore the answer is money. From the perspective of a central bank it is infinitely printable, or non-scarce.

...Which btw is why gold-bugs exist.

There are some other variations of this answer that would also be correct answers to the question btw.

You could, by the same token say that a company could issue infinite equity *shares* with infinite stock splits (exchange rules aside, of course). Again, the total value would remain constant. But from a quantitative standpoint, new shares can be created infinitely. They are non-scarce.

Another example is debt. Debt is infinitely issuable. Again, it's value would plummet, but a sovereign government could (for example) issue an infinite amount of 0% debt. It would of course be fiscally irresponsible in the extreme -- but it is as non-scarce from a sovereign perspective as money is. (From a modern debt-based economy standpoint of course, debt and money are one in the same -- so the first answer is still the best one: Money).",6,1476279665.0

t3_58oke2,d924ab1,"Let's take the side pro free trade first. This side says that in basically a globalized market, everyone should compete with each other for lowest prices for a good. This will also allow only cheap and or quality goods to exist as more expensive poorer quality goods eventually will not be able to compete. However, most countries outside of the US can produce goods at a lower cost because the US has a comparatively higher cost of living/doing business. (Imagine a country with no environmental controls/fees.) This is good on a free market/globalization scale (generally good for big companies already operating in multiple countries) but hurts locally produced goods generally as they cannot compete on price.  
  
The con side to free trade is that it hurts Americans, especially workers. The American min wage worker might want $15/hr for their work, their other country counterpart might do the same job for less than $1/day. If you don't pay your employees as much - you can afford to produce goods at a lower cost. However, if every American has a good job - maybe more goods are bought anyways for retailers in America.   
  
So that's where the pro/con thing. Now if you say what are economists trying to say - there are two ideas. One is that an unregulated economy is the very idea of ""free market"" - lets call these economist - ""idealist"". The other is that a free market is prone to spikes and other nasty things that may reek havoc on a nation - lets call these economist - ""realist"". Now that is where the debate is - should we have an idealist economy or a realist economy. The answer is still debated - but generally more Americans are happier with a realist economy. However, the rich and/or already powerful corporations would benefit and/or make more profit if it was an idealist economy. That should explain why you see different articles about both. Let me know if that helps.",12,1477075861.0
t3_58oke2,d924utq,"I studied Economics in school, but allow me to say I am no expert or highly certified authority. First, let me say that I believe that economics hardly ever has one single right answer. I view economics as finance/business based on human behavior. Economists have to assume people are rational (otherwise there are so many differing variables that you might as well throw a dart while blindfolded), though due to different opinions on what is rational there will still be different opinions on why X may or may not lead to Y.
International trade is a great example since it is so prevalent to Americans today with TPP on the horizon. I'm going to try and keep it as short yet accurate as possible.

Free trade means: less barriers to trade (like tariffs). Encourages specialization between nations regarding exports (goods/services).
Example: southeast asia has looser labor laws than the US, creating cheaper labor costs (wages, safety requirements, etc.) for businesses. Lower costs will attract foreign businesses to move their production to the region. Cheaper input costs lead to cheaper costs for consumers.
Summary: Free trade --> companies are attracted to cheaper labor regions --> jobs go from here to there --> cheaper costs create cheaper prices for consumers.

Less free trade means: more obstructions like tariffs and/or quotas are established regarding imported and exported goods. The trading process would be generally more expensive for the countries involved.
Example: US government creates tariffs on goods from southeast asia to discourage this trade. Assuming the appropriate government regulations are used, it could instead be more expensive to move business overseas (such as manufacturing to southeast asia). Jobs remain in the US with the company costs being higher than free trade company costs. These costs are passed on to the consumer in higher prices.
Summary: Gov regulations make international trade more expensive --> domestic companies remain here --> jobs stay here --> higher costs make higher prices for consumers.

Personally, I think international trade is generally good (as do most people) because it does lower costs and promotes specialization within the world economy. However, each country needs different amount of free trade in order to take care of its own population as best as possible. For economies as large and capable as the US, I don't think we need as much free trade as many countries. We could probably keep many of the manufacturing jobs (that are going overseas) that support much of the lower-middle(ish) class and easily absorb the slightly higher prices of goods for consumers. Instead, by sending the jobs overseas, many of the Americans who need the lower prices the most are also losing their jobs because they do not have the means or capability to just jump into a different labor industry. America's economy might grow in GDP (maybe), but a lot of that growth would go to those who don't need the extra help. I relate it to income inequality, but that's a discussion for another time.

EDIT: realized I focused mostly on trade and didn't really make a specific conclusion on bringing jobs back or not. I think it's better for the country because it would keep jobs for those who don't have the capability (and mostly education) to switch to a services job rather than manufacturing. Sending jobs overseas helps lower prices helping everyone, but the people who lose those manufacturing jobs probably have to take minimum wage jobs instead, if they can even find another job due to increased competition from the other people looking for new jobs. In the end I see it as helping the lower class at a minor cost to middle and upper class compared to helping the middle and lower class a little bit and screwing a lot of the lower half.",5,1477076574.0
t3_58oke2,d92b9us,"The ""jobs"" issue is really that most of the good-paying jobs have left the country. The jobs that remain are much lower quality and pay a lot less than the old manufacturing jobs. A huge percentage of current jobs are in retail, which is almost always low-paying. In addition, thanks to Obamacare, many of these same retail jobs are only part-time, in order to keep corporations from having to provide health care.

When a large chunk of the population is making barely-above-poverty wages, and an even bigger chunk is not working at all, the economy will suffer. Low paid workers can't spend much money on anything but necessities. This cause retail stores to lose sales and profits (and has been happening the last few years). Many stores have gone bankrupt. 

Yes, the internet has hurt brick and mortar stores, but the fact that many citizens just don't have any money to spare is the real killer. 

TLDR, a service-based economy cannot survive long term. It just creates a death spiral for corporations. ",3,1477085105.0
t3_58oke2,d92gom7,"In economics there are winners and losers, any economic event or policy change will benefit some while harming others.  So one thing to keep in mind when reading/discussing international trade, trade agreements, etc is that some group of individuals/business will be better off and another group will be worse off.  This is one large reason why people can cite articles supporting free trade and why others can cite other articles in opposition of free trade.  So with that being said, let's look at the free trade argument with a hypothetical scenario.

Suppose the U.S. initially imposes prohibitively large tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. so that it is practically impossible for items to come into the U.S., then everything will be made in the U.S. by U.S. workers, and made with U.S. raw materials.  But then one day the U.S. government decides to take away those tariffs.  Companies like Nike and Apple will begin to look at their labor costs and realize that they could make their products in some other country with lower wages and then ship them back to the U.S. for a small shipping fee.   This is going to be bad for the Nike and Apple employees in the U.S. that lose their jobs and they will now have to go find a new job.  At the same time Apple and Nike's costs have gone down, allowing them to lower the price of their goods and also still increase their profit.  The American consumer that buys these goods now pays less for them.  So in summation; the Apple or Nike worker is made worse off while Apple/Nike and the consumer that buys their products is made better off.  
Protectionist policies are often put in place at the insistence of labor unions trying to protect the losers of free trade, the workers that they represent.  
The example above doesn't even get into areas of trade such as comparative advantage, economic surplus, trade balance, or deadweight loss. These are slightly more in-depth topics but are important economic variables which are also affected by whether we allow free trade or not.  

As for whether bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. would make our economy more efficient, no.  Economic efficiency is getting the maximum output from your inputs.  An efficient economy means that given all of the labor, capital and raw materials that we have we consume the maximum amount of goods and services possible.  If we bring those jobs back to the U.S. then the prices of those goods will have to go back up due to labor costs and therefore consumers will not be able to afford as many products.  So now people would be consuming less than before, which by the definition above would be a decline in efficiency.  

As for prices, yes prices would go up.  Initially the prices of some goods would go up faster than other prices, i.e. relative prices would change.  This could cause the prices of goods/services that never went abroad in the first place to also change.  Once these  prices started to go up then people would start demanding higher wages to keep their living standards constant.  If their wages go up then it would drive up prices again, but by less.  This cycle could go back and forth a few times but then eventually there would be a new equilibrium of prices and wages where they stabilize. 

Finally, America is not a truly free-trade country.  We have free-trade agreements with 20 other countries; NAFTA, GATT (which is now under the WTO), CAFTA-DR, etc.  So any other country that we trade with we often impose a tariff or quota on their exports and they generally do the same for our exports. Even within these free-trade agreements there are items exempt from being tariff-free.  
I hope this helps.",3,1477093673.0
t3_58oke2,d9293ul,"This is a really complex situation, but I'll try to break down some of the issues. 

There's a couple of things that spring to mind regarding this discussion. Firstly, generally speaking, free trade is good *for the country as a whole* but might not be great for a subset or particular demographic. For instance, importing clothes made in Bangladesh allows me as a consumer to buy a shirt at Walmart for $5. If the same shirt was made in the U.S., it would be much more expensive because the cost of labor/land is more expensive in the U.S.. We might be able to balance this out with a tariff against goods from overseas, but all that does is artificially increase the prices that consumers pay. If you're looking to provide cheaper products for the lower class, tariffs are the opposite of what you want. 

Secondly, you have to ask the questions, what type of manufacturing is still present in U.S. and how do we compete with international firms? The second question is by far the more important. Because of the cost of labor, the plants that do exist are highly efficient, automated places. They have fewer people, but technology allows them to produce superior quality products or increase their economies of scale for the number of employees they do have. This level of technology requires more education and/or expertise than it did 40 years ago. The days of graduating high school and going directly into a middle class salary are declining and the type of plants necessary for global competition are not conducive to this level of education. 

An example is that in the cotton industry, the purity of the product matters. One of the ways that the U.S. cotton industry competes is that it has some of the purest cotton in the world and is almost completely automated in its collection and packaging. This type of quality is worth paying extra for to a lot of clothing companies. In most commercial farms, there are very few people that are employed and most of it is automated. Even so, this industry receives government subsidies to compete internationally. 

Now, let's move to the idea that price might go up for a bit, but everyone would be better off. I'm not so sure. For instance, if Jockey moved its clothing manufacturing back, they're not going to hire the same number of people that they did in Columbia. They simply can't pay U.S. workers the same and still compete with international companies. So, in order to stay in business, they have to be more efficient than their overseas competitors. This means automation and a lower number of workers in the plant. 

The assumption that prices would level out, but people would be better off is incorrect. The only way that this works is if the company has no international competitors and sells all its product inside the U.S.. If they have even one outside competitor that can sell at a cheaper price. If they sell overseas, their product is now more expensive. Both of these lead to declining sales, fewer jobs, and fewer manufacturing companies in the U.S..

By taxing this way you begin to reward the active wealth builders, as they should be putting their money into the market, labor, or capital in order to avoid the tax. It also relieves pressure on wages as anywhere from 25-50 percent or more of a persons income is now taxed in one form or another.

If you don't, no one will pay attention to you and you are buying products 'off the shelf' as it were. If they are 'on the shelf', the secret is out so the efficient market already knows what you think no one else knows (and if its discussed in a movie, then everyone already knows about it and you are thus the 'dumb money' that 'smart money' is eagerly waiting to take from you).

Your best bet is to find the closest proxy for the market you think is in a bubble ready to burst, and then see if you can either a) buy put options b) find an inverse ETF that tracks that market or something similar.

So if you think it's real estate again, you might be able to short (e.g. buy puts) against REITs for example, or possibly mortgage bond funds, or non-bank mortgage lenders. BUT, history doesn't repeat although it can rhyme, as the saying goes. So although an economic crisis is statistically overdue, it's highly unlikely that the next one will be an exact replay of 2008 housing-induced debt crisis crisis all over again.

t3_5mskpl,dc6n8cx,"As a former ""Debt Hawk"" myself (I occasionally run an econ blog) what I can say is that this problem is not confined to the US, and a lot of it has come about because of lower tax levels introduced in the early 1980s. 

One of the important things about high levels of government debt is that the government *must* pay interest on the money it has borrowed, and then pay back the principal onces the bond finishes.

Of course one way to deal with this problem is to borrow money from the market to pay back what you owe. But that isn't actually a solution since all you're doing is making the problem worse.

What concerns me the most about high levels of government debt is that, as debt increases, so too does the amount of money needed to pay off that debt. This means that government spending is increasingly directed towards debt servicing. This is money that could be spent on education, health care, infrastructure, and so on.

Japan has been borrowing money for decades. Its current debt/GDP is around 300% IIRC. But the price of servicing this debt is low because interest rates are so low. The interest rates in the US are also low enough for it to be less of a problem.

[This graph](http://i.imgur.com/IGPEMgt.png) is from one of the data spreadsheets I have, and shows how much debt servicing the US government has paid since 1951, as a percentage of GDP. 

As you can see, Reagan and Laffer put America in the lurch in the late 1980s with deficit spending. Clinton and the Republican congress worked together (!) to create a budget surplus which, together with an expanding economy, brought things under control during the 1990s.

The graph also shows that deficit spending during the Vietnam War also increased debt repayments - and these repayments were greater than the inflation which eroded debt in the 1970s.

----------

My solution is simple: raise taxes. Raising taxes will increase tax revenue, and the government will have more money to cover costs. Raise taxes far enough and you end up with a revenue surplus, which can be used to buy back the principal and reduce debt levels even further.

I believe that balance is an important axiom in economics. A national government's debts should remain net zero over the long term. This allows for periods of debt increase, but also periods of debt reduction. The business cycle is the driver of this phenomenon. So, in theory, a national government should go into deficit during bad times and go into surplus in the good times, with a zero net balance overall.

I do believe large debt levels hinder an economy's ability to perform at a reasonable level. The government bond market is huge, and people are making money simply by lending to the government so it can run its daily activities rather than lending to businesses so they can invest in capital. There is a level of ""crowding out"" that occurs.

t3_5myuc5,dc7goa0,"First you have to look at the simplicity of an economic system.  It is people earning and spending the same money over and over again.  You perform labor and you earn $100, you spend that $100 on something someone else just performed labor for, they spend it on something else, earn/spend, earn/spend over and over again the same currency gets traded between humans.  As long as this cycle continues and an economy can provide enough jobs for everyone within it, the system works fine.


So when this cycle begins to break an imbalance is created.  In the USA the economy started to break when business owners moved their companies to China and when technology advancement started taking over human jobs.  So this created a larger labor pool of humans all competing for jobs which means business owners can pay lower wages.  So less and less jobs are available and people are getting paid less and less which means they are spending less and less and the economy stops growing.  All while the more successful business owners are accumulating more and more profits for themselves.  Which is why today we have the greatest income/wealth inequality in economic history.


So to answer your question ""why raise taxes""?  Because in a capitalist economy like the USA there is no other logical solution, because the people who have the most money within an economy will not just start creating jobs so the people with no money can start earning it.  Unfortunately raising taxes only works when you have politicians who are not corrupt and actually care about the majority of the population and not only the ones at the top who bribe them.


So if the politicians in the USA were logical they would only raise taxes on the wealthiest people and use that money to create jobs for people who have very little money. (similar to what FDR did in the 1940s when he taxed everyone in the USA who made over $250k per year at a 90% tax rate) This would shift the money from the top to the middle class and create economic growth since the middle class within any economy always spends the most money.


Anyway this is just a simplified explanation, but the US gov is so corrupt nothing like this would every happen nor do I think it is a good permanent solution, but thats just my opinion....  most likely they will just keep printing more fiat currency and the debt will continue increasing...

Presently speaking, the majority of wealth in both the U.S. and the world is just sitting there unused by only a handful of wealthy. It just makes sense to tax the fuck out of them and restore purchasing power to the lower socioeconomic classes that can barely afford basic things like healthcare and monthly rent.

Fundamentally, Russia has huge surplus and giant reserve. Its currency suppose to be strong, as it is an oil based country.

Geopolitically, Obama was fucking russian currency (via wall st. manipulation) to retaliate against Snowden.

So, now you arrive to a point, asking... how much does a currency worth? Can american keep manipulating ruble, and is Russian economy as weak as they want the world to believe? (vis a vis current account and trade balance?)

then you arrive to your personal question... how much does your money really worth in 2-3 yrs?  i doubt anybody know for sure.  Current state of geopolitical and global economy are very tense.

You have to remember that there is massive currency war in the far east. Yuan, Yen vs. dollar.  On top of potential oil price fluctuation. 

Essentially, if Trump lost currency war, dollar will go even higher. 10-15% east.  If there is middle east war, oil will go higher, dollar will flood the world, ruble will go much higher, ~45 or so.

In the near term, there is no reason, ruble doesn't go higher as long as oil export and russian economy are stable. To be honest, it's  little speculators (like you) that keep running around exchanging money that causes crazy fluctuation of currency.  Think about it, what happen if everybody in your country is doing exactly the same?  regardless if your economy is good or bad.  Just because you want to speculate against dollar, that you have very little information about.

do you honestly know the safety dollar can offer given the totality of geopolitical situation? (currency war in far east, oil price, Trump administration instability.)

see the problem there? Basically, it's like being in little boat with 500 idiots, everybody running to one side of boat because they see little frog.  Of course the boat will lose it balance and everybody sinks.

You can't think like you do. You have to spread your investment around. Not betting everything on single variable that you know nothing about.

Because then, all one has to do is scream... I see a frog on left side of boat. And you know every idiot on the boat will run to the right and sink the boat.

In other word, you are in an idiot game. Either you try to calculate how every idiot in that boat will act if hearing 'there is a frog', or you get out and get a new game.

The other 97% of currency is digital, and created by private banks like Goldman Sachs when you go in to the bank and sign a loan document like a mortgage.  Long ago, banks could only loan money they had in standing reserve on site.  But now that's not so.  When you sign a loan document, the currency that is credited to your account did not exist before you signed the document - the digital funds are credited to your account with no hard currency to back them, the bank literally creates the credit out of thin air.

Look man, health care is a solved problem except in the US where doctors and insurers take huge (completely unnecessary) cuts. In other countries, there aren't any insurance companies and doctor pay is pushed down by the single payer (the government). 

In the US, doctors are **literally** the highest paid people in the US workforce, insurance companies take a further 30% or more of every transaction (for no good reason, really), pharma charges whatever they can pull out their ass, and costs will only go up since the US government pays for all this and seems happy to keep doing it on into the foreseeable future. 

Obamacare was a bandage on a system that keeps demanding more money (doctor pay and insurance and pharma). At some point, it will end. Maybe. The whole thing is completely crazy but I guess since the US government can keep printing money forever it won't. I think maybe some point in the future you'll have top doctors making hundreds of times the average US worker, insurance companies getting a huge cut of that, for no reason, and pharma charging many thousands of dollars per for pills that are essentially sugar placebos. 

Anyone who has seriously looked at the system has commented at how insane it is and tried to reform it. Even Republicans. Notably Mitt Romney and Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Governments are paying private companies to provide care for patients. It's insane. 

The whole idea that private companies can do anything more ""efficiently"" than government is a complete fabrication. Let's get that straight. Overhead + employee pay is less than overhead + employee pay + profits every single time. Especially when you consider a private company wants more and more profit all the time.

Poor people spend *all of their income.*  Month-to-month, living paycheck-to-paycheck, poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities, utilities, etc.  Rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes.  Most of it gets stashed in hedgefunds and overseas holdings and doesn't really ""change hands"" in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure.

So your tax continuously hits 100% of the wealth of the bottom 75%(ish) of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can *spend*.

In short, this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who doesn't make $300k+ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth.

If you want to help the general public (households making less than $300k/year), you need to generate more tax revenue from *investments* and *capital gains*.

Note, though, that very little money is enturely taken out of the economy -- cash stuffed under mattresses. When most people ""save"" money (e.g. in a bank account), they're actually loaning it out for someone else to use, in exchange for interest. When your money is in the bank, it's just a number in a ledger. ",13,1500817999.0
t3_6p1bgw,dklttzu,"There are a few different ways you can look at this.

You can't really take money out of the economy, as it can't ""leave society"" and the economy is the interaction of society. One example kind of close to this was a multi-millionaire died without an heir with millions in his bank account. The bank will continue to use the funds, but the money itself won't be spent. Some people saw this as a ""waste"", like value was lost, but really all it does (hoarding money or even burning it) is change the money supply.

That being said there are two approaches to looking at capitalism as a *balanced* ecosystem. One is Keynesianism, which focuses on demand. The other is Marxism, which focuses on more internal mechanisms of capitalism. Both are concerned with inequality.

With high inequality, those with capital tend to have more reinvestment as a percentage of income/wealth. With a return on investment this will increase inequality. The Keynesian issue is that this will lower demand, creating imbalance in the economy and long-term problems to function. The answer was more redistribution and higher labor wages.

For Marxists, they believe that capitalism generates endless ""capital accumulation"", not because of a demand component, but because of labor theory of value. That wealth and value is not determined by the market, but at exploitation of labor. On this critical side you have critiques of the fetishism of market value. With high inequality you have money ""leaving the system"" in what some call waste--something not socially useful. Baran and Sweezy in ""Monopoly Capital"" talk about this in the form of things like military spending, and, I think, advertisement. But it can also relate to the generation of ""wealth"" (opposed to income). Things that don't hold inherent value, like art, becomes investment. You can't say it is ""taken out of "" the economy, but the value itself is generated by those who can purchase it. Though, I believe this value fetishism is more an outcome of the contradictions, rather than the cause.

What it does contribute to contradictions, however, is the rise of speculation. Rather than consumption or productive investment, accumulation will increasingly become speculative. Real estate is usually the primary example. Many people buy houses, condos, or land, not for use, but for the expectation that the value will go up. When bad enough this can reshape the market, so for people who aren't investing their rent/living cost increases. 

This likewise happens with stocks and other financial investments. Again, it can't really ""leave the economy"", but it makes it more difficult for the ""traditional"" or productive and labor economy to operate. ",4,1500818669.0

t3_79384i,doytn50,"Its definitely not a stupid question. The average American has absolutely no idea how this process works. I know this might be annoying, but I'm answering without 100% certainty. 

The Fed would increase the money supply by buying back government bonds. This increased demand for bonds would raise their price and therefore lower the interest return that they deliver. Since U.S. treasury bonds are considered to be the very safest possible investment, their rate is the ""risk free"" rate upon which all other rates are based. So if the government buys billions of these bonds, that much money ends up in the hands of whoever sold them. These sellers are the large financial organizations that hold all of our money (banks and large investment vehicles). Now, since bond rates are lower, they have an incentive to put that money somewhere else. It goes into stocks and investment in business ventures. 

I'm less certain about how this turns into inflation that consumers will recognize. The short answer is that there is only a finite number of goods and services for us to buy. If the amount of money increases and there are still the same number of goods and services, the prices will increase slightly. 

Your question about printing money to pay off debts is too complex for me to answer. I know that the inflation dynamic does play a role. It makes debts easier to pay off in the future than they seem right now. However, causing massive inflation to pay off debts brings a lot of other problems. ",4,1509114976.0

Companies do not lend back money from the same source they collected the loan from...if they did then you would have the easiest arbitrage scheme in the history of finance (try lending back to the bank where you got your mortgage from). Hazlitt puts it pretty clear and straightforward; there's consumer savings in tax cuts IF and only IF there is an equal reduction in government spending.

t3_7bq71v,dpk2w4v,"I am a former banker and Econ masters student. These are my opinions based on the empirical stuff I've read, but I'm not a tax expert by any means:

Yes, Bernie Sanders wanted to raise taxes on the rich, which I think on the whole is the right idea. The capital gains tax is a huge untapped revenue pool. Warren Buffet even noted that he pays 15% while his secretary pays like 30-35% and he acknowledges that isn't right and shows our twisted priorities. I think corporate taxes could stand to be raised a few percent. The level at which your income tax is 0 should be raised, maybe a lot? Maybe 50k or more even? It is true that when things are taxed, businesses and consumers seek alternatives, but this is also how policy can be a tool to encourage the things we want and discourage the things we don't. I suspect that we could have lowered unemployment after the great recession more quickly if we had lowered the business taxes associated with payroll. Basically lowering the cost for a business to employ people.

As I understand it, the idea that lowering taxes across the board would stimulate the economy way overstates the economic boost relative to the damage to the deficit. There is no guarantee that the savings corporations would realize would be reinvested domestically. Famously Apple is sitting on like $1T cash. Wouldn't it be nice if they expanded? Hired more people? You can't just force them to do that, but you can set up incentives. There are uncountable non-tax regulations which are a worse drag on economic efficiency which should be reviewed as well. 

I've often wondered what the effect would be of a system where corporations were granted a tax credit (or deduction) for giving bonuses to non-executive employees. This would put money directly in the hands of those most likely to spend it and the loss in direct taxes would be captured through sales and profit taxes after the money has circulated more. It would probably create inflationary pressure, but since it has been so low for so long, maybe the ends justify the means. (Google/Wiki the concept of the velocity of money).

What seems to always be missing from the tax debate is how the taxes are spent. We elect generally incompetent/corrupt legislators then we complain that they misuse our taxes. If we could be confident that the funds were spent effectively, and to the benefit of most people, I bet a lot fewer people would complain so much about the taxman. Instead of incurring massive costs using our military to occupy every corner of the earth, maybe instead we could charge a fee to do more training of local forces, sell them more weapons. Turn a cost into a revenue. Maybe if we resisted the pharma and insurance lobbies, we could save a trillion$ on healthcare... the list goes on.

Like you said, it's all shades of gray.

t3_7bq71v,dpklw8j,"A good tax would fall squarely on the mechanisms that create wealth-based income.  This is where inequality comes from, and this is what drains money out of the economy removing the ability to build net worth through work.  The interesting thing is, this is already a solved problem.  We've had it before, and we fixed it. 

Back a few hundred years ago, wealth-based income was primarily derived from real-estate.  Land and buildings were where almost all long-term wealth ended up, and this made wealthy land owners entitled to living better than everyone else. It wasn't fair.  Wars were fought, heads rolled, and we exited that era with the property tax.  This took the wealth-based income out of the economy by taxing the property that created it and providing a mechanism for that money to be redistributed into the economy through government spending.   This was a resilient and self balancing system, since the more money property could earn for it's owner, the more it was worth in the market, the higher its assessed value, and the more it was taxed.  If taxes were too high, its value dropped in the market, its taxes dropped and everything rebalanced.   When the economy slowed you could increase the recapture of wealth-based income by increasing the property tax rate and when times were good you could reduce it.  

Now, we live in a completely different era and the primary sources of wealth-based income are not real-estate.  To figure out what makes wealth-based income these days look at the capital assets of valuable corporations.  It's a huge array of machinery, software, patents, copyrights, vehicles, and all sorts of infrastructure from communication networks to oil wells and refineries.  This all exists in a framework of free trade which creates a global tax loophole for the rich by creating an economic environment where property taxes are a competitive disadvantage forcing taxes off of commercial property capable of earning money.  Even real-estate has been effected with taxes being driven off of farmland.  Free trade locks this in by allowing property to be taxed somewhere other than where it earns its income. 

To fix all this I recommend a new theoretical approach to taxation.  It's the responsibility of every government remove enough of the wealth-based income from its economy to allow its participants prosperity as measured by their ability to build net worth through labor.  It can do that however it feels best, but it should focus on taxing all things capable of earning money for its owner (a.k.a. property) roughly in line with its value.  Since this requires taxing property that doesn't exist inside your borders, it means we need to refine the idea of free trade to allow cross-border taxation.  The goal is to keep a level playing field where things happen where it's most efficient for them to happen without forcing taxes off of wealth-based income.  I call this ""neutral trade"".  There are a number of ways this could be accomplished, but the idea I like best is to roll property taxes into trade deals so that governments all tax the property in their jurisdictions themselves, and then get together and figure out who owes who money by figuring out which countries earned money from which properties and pro-rating things based on that.  Then the countries can simply settle things up with each other.  It eliminates the ability to create a competitive advantage by lowering taxes on your side of the border, but otherwise keeps the efficiency benefits of free trade. 

This would be a huge change, not only because it would require trade agreement changes, but because it would vastly expand what would be subject to tax to include all kinds of things that go completely untaxed currently.  This is the best part though, since these new taxes would reign in the constant drain of wealth-based income on our economies and allow us to reduce or even eliminate income taxation.  It would provide a framework where basic income could be implemented in a way that is sensible and doesn't force some of us to support others.  It would create a situation where poorer countries aren't constantly drained of money by the property-rich countries so they could finally start building prosperity and hope for their people.  This would all come at the expense of the rich, but since it wouldn't remove their wealth or their heads they'll end up with a smaller piece of a much bigger pie and even they will likely end up better off, and since we're avoiding a dystopian future where automation removes all value from work, their grandchildren, and all of our grandchildren will definitely end up better off.",2,1510237342.0

A centralized system such as the one adopted in URSS lacked the flexibility necessary to dissipate a problem like corruption. They had a very efficent and solid system in the first years after the revolution, WWII permitted to capitalize on the progress this system brought by consolidating their influence to other countries and further push the economy. 

After this period however, both with late Stalin and who followed his ruling, the comand chain that characterized their efficent industrial plans was cracked slighlty, but inesorably by corruption. 
In the beginning they had programmed a great PC which worked perfectly, later on bugs started to appear and slightly nothing worked as it should have anymore. 

Capitalistic growth was wilder, but also more flexible. The first quinquennial plans URSS pushed where towards heavy metallurgy (if i remember correctly), let's say there was no corruption and everything worked. 
In the meantime in the USA there was no precise direction of development but a general push towards innovation.

Capitalism autoregulates this and, when it doesn't do it in time, we get 2008, 1929 and so on, but after that we are back on track because this crysises are usually sectorial even if they impact the whole economy. In URSS however if the metallurgy plans had failed you could not build anything that came after that as you had no real alternative and the chain of progress would be broken.
 
The cold war gave the final touch by isolating URSS and making it impossible for it to rely on other countries for industrial products.

t3_7pxm6v,dsl1u92,"Maybe, but there is no longer a way to regulate capitalism within the existing US structure because corporations and particularly huge corporations have essentially taken over the entire political system.  

After ""Citizens United"" there are no adequate restrictions on corporate power within the political system.  Corporations can: 

1) Expend unlimited funds destroying their enemies with dark money propaganda campaigns, limited only by their profits, and plenty of huge corporations and corporate sectors have enough profit to hijack any efforts to regulate them and to destroy their enemies in the political process.

2) They can donate to politicians and their employees can in ways that bundle into massive and distorting donations to anti-regulation candidates.  

3) They currently control both major political parties. The major funding sources for the Democrats are pretty similar to the Republicans, huge corporations and wealthy folks.  That wasn't always true for the Democrats but with the collapse of the private sector unions that were once a major alternative funding source (they exist, but are much much weaker than the pre - 80's era), it is certainly true now. 

I don't see any mechanism to correct this until corporations don't have the same rights as people in order to restrict their dark money limitless political spending, and that power itself will make it impossible to reach a point where corporations will not have those rights because they will destroy anyone who tries to create a system that could regulate them or their current preeminence.  

Perhaps a well regulated capitalism could serve many people in the US, but currently that is impossible and every corporate sector that is regulated by the US tends to have agency captured its regulator body.  

Look at net neutrality for example, the FCC repealed it at the behest of the huge internet providers like Comcast under an appointee chairman who was formerly working for Verizon.  

Agency capture has occurred all across the regulatory apparatus of the US government to the point that Corporations are essentially regulating themselves, i.e. real regulation of corporate power is basically over.  

Under the status quo of both parties being addicted to corporate power and money as well as afraid of the dark money attacks huge corporations can launch against their enemies at will and essentially without regulation, there is no real way that the system can self correct.  I would say things will have to get much much worse before they can get any better because of how structurally broken the US gov is in terms of its complete inability to restrain the power of large corporations during this current era of corporate power and control.

The pure form of just about any political ideology isn't viable.

Pure democracy doesn't work because there are too many issues and too much complexity to have the entire populace voting on EVERYTHING.

Pure socialism doesn't work because you completely remove the motivation to work.

Pure capitalism would mean no restrictions or regulations, and it would quickly turn us into a two class society of the rich exploiting the poor.

I believe in Bernie's ideology of Democratic Socialism. The very name hints at a blend. Capitalism is great at growing wealth, so let's add that in and keep it regulated. A republic form of government is great at giving citizens power through their votes, but allows experienced, dedicated professionals to deal with the management of government. Socialism is great at redistributing much of the wealth generated by capitalism, and helping the poor to step up into the middle class.

t3_7ymrah,dui0ssl,"This is a good question.  I like to search for truth, and it can be hard in a polarized media landscape.  So how do you do it?

* Look for source data, you can trust it.  You can find reliable numbers on GDP growth, unemployment, percentage of people in poverty, stock market prices, housing prices, etc.  These are truths.

* Once armed with data, then read articles from both sides.  Evaluate the analysis based upon your source data.  It’s pretty easy to tell who’s spinning too hard.  Discount their analysis if the facts aren’t correct.

* Be open minded.  If someone has a defensible fact that doesn’t agree with your worldview, know that you’ve discovered your own bias.  We all have them.  Be willing to listen to reason, and be willing to change your mind.

I’ll give you my opinion.  I think our economy is bifurcated (broken into two very different portions).  In the top half, skilled people are doing well.  They’re educated, highly compensated, can switch jobs at will, and live pretty good lives.  On the bottom, life without good skills is hard.  People work multiple job but have trouble affording a house, family, and the rest of the American dream.  Opportunities are scarce and they live in fear of losing their job.  Trump really spoke to the bottom half to get elected, and they feel better.  I’m unclear how much better they’re actually doing, we should look that up (unemployment rates, wage growth, etc).  

I also think presidents have limited effect on the economy.  They set tax policy, federal spending, and can influence confidence from the bully pulpit.  I think Trumps has done a few positive things: 1) cut taxes which will spur economic growth in the short term, 2) business investment picked up in anticipation of cuts, and 3) he’s energized the bottom half of the economy — those folks have much more confidence and are spending.  So there has been improvement.

It takes a while for these effects to kick in.  While early 2017 was still an Obama economy, it’s much more Trump now.  So the policies are doing well so far.  At some point it will all be Trump.

So while it’s better, there’s tremendous momentum and inertia in the economy.  I’d encourage you to look at the long-term trend lines starting in 2009.  While good things are up, it does look more like a continuation of previous trends.  Things went up under Obama, and continue to go up under Trump.  Did Trump make it better, or did he just ride the existing wave?

t3_7ylqkd,duhw761,"Rather than sifting through the unsubstantiated claims of redditors, why not run the numbers yourself. Figure out what you think a reasonable UBI would be, then times it by the US population, then compare that expenditure with the total Federal budget and tell me if you think it's a reasonable program. 

Here's an example, but feel free to use whatever numbers you like. Let's use $10,000. Times that by an estimated 327,000,000 people living in America and you get $3,270,000,000,000. A quick look at the most recent Federal expenditure I could find, [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expenditures_in_the_United_States_federal_budget), was $3.27 trillion. So a UBI of $10k would cost as much as the entire Federal budget. 

Social program expenditures include $1,060B for Medicare and Medicaid, $910B for Social Security, and $420B (2014) for food stamps, unemployment, etc. That totals some $2.4 trillion, leaving us some $800B short from the UBI's expenditure. 

I see two options to make up that $800B. We could raise taxes some $800B, which to put that in perspective, is about half of the Federal income tax revenue ($1.7T) being [forecasted for 2019](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-tax-revenue-3305762). In other words, you'd have to raise income taxes by nearly 50%. 

Or instead of raising taxes that much, you could lower the UBI from $10k to $7.5k. That makes a more management Federal expenditure of $2.4T, which is on par with the the total we spend on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other social programs like Food Stamps and Unemployment.

There are two problems with replacing our existing social safety nets with UBI however. One, about a third of Federal revenue comes from payroll taxes, ie Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. It wouldn’t be fair for people to continue to pay into those programs if they were being eliminated, so payroll taxes would have to be replaced with a revenue neutral increase in taxes elsewhere. (Which now that I think of it isn’t much of a problem in my view.)

The second problem, is that the average Social Security recipient, currently receives just under [$17k](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apos-much-average-american-collecting-010000000.html) a year in benefits. It’s going to be a hard sell to the elderly that they should support a $7.5k or even $10k UBI. That’s not even looking at the other social programs. 

And there in lies the problem with UBI. It slashes benefits for those who need it most all under a guise of fairness. And if you place the UBI high enough to not slash benefits for retirees and the sick, then you’re left with an unworkable Federal expenditure (a $17k UBI comes out to $5.56T a year). 

From here we could attempt to offer separate UBIs to different classes of people, but as far as Im concerned that wouldn’t be a very **Universal** Basic Income, so I’ll just end this already lengthily post here.

Historically as production efficiency increased, it allowed for more 'leisure time' where unproductive endeavors could be pursued; the arts, sciences, philosophy, etc. These things, though unproductive themselves would lead to greater understanding and life satisfaction. So the goal has been to increase productivity in order to increase the amount of non-essential work available. However, we have reached a point where we have created a slew of time-wasting jobs which don't improve anything at all.

As we approach a point where production efficiency is maximized and resources finite, there is little reason to pursue a global policy of never-ending growth and full-employment. A shift to UBI would allow a floor for people to exist and live a relatively comfortable life with the possibility of pursuing leisurely activities, self-improvement, or creating things that society may not need but improve quality of life. 

Meanwhile, jobs could exist as something that people would sacrifice their freedom for in exchange for doing what was needed, either for greater reward (i.e. income) or because it was something they were truly passionate about or committed to.

t3_8w1f71,e1s505q,"Two problems.

Communism is a complicated topic. There is no One True definition, and every decade or so new nuances get added to it. A simplified graph of the evolution of current Communist theory in China might look like Marxism->Marxist-Leninism->Stalinism->Maoism->Modern China. When most people say ""Communism"" they mean Marxism, but they completely ignore all the steps in between a nearly 200 year theory and its modern execution.

Capitalism is also a complicated problem few people understand. Adam Smith's vision of Capitalism was... that it was an insult. The word ""capitalism"" in his day was a *negative version* of what he called Individualism. Capitalism referred to the excess of corporatism, where fire departments would let a house burn to the ground if they hadn't paid up, where governments were second to monied interests, etc. Adam Smith didn't want an absolutely free market & laissez fare state though good luck getting most people to understand that. He actually argued in favor of the state owning the commons (stuff too expensive to expect private enterprise to create, but needed by most of the population - roads, centralized water/power networks, things like that) and for state intervention against monopolistic powers, which themselves would distort and destroy the free market. He had a *very* nuanced position, not ""The Free Market Solves Everything"" as most people would ascribe to him.

So, is your question what elements does Marxism share with Modern China? Well, the Chinese government still nationalizes most of the Commons - something a truly capitalist state wouldn't do, but something Adam Smith wouldn't really see as a problem and Karl Marx would say is an absolute necessity. Marxism **never** called for the abolition of private property, that's propaganda - Marx *did* call for the abolition of private ownership of the means of production. Adam Smith would say that markets are better served by private enterprise, so by allowing private ownership of the means of production, China has effectively shifted far more towards Smith than Marx. Marx demanded a Command Economy, with total control of the economy in the hands of the state. Smith, of course, advocated for the invisible hand to guide the economy. Right now, China is a *mix* of both approaches. In a macro sense, China intervenes in major industries with subsidies and even quotas, but for everything else China just regulates the free market.

China is a one party state, definitely Marxist-Leninist. China has elections, to which Smith and capitalists are agnostic, but those elections **are not** truly democratic in nature. That is **anti-marxist**, as Marx envisioned the state melting away into a true, direct democracy. The single-party totalitarian state thing was really Stalin's idea, Lenin viewed his state as more of a necessarily evil transitional authority while Stalin viewed it as a permanent thing.

---

China is not what Marx would call Communist. Nothing ever has been - direct democracy, pure command economy, public ownership of means of production - but it is still a Communist state. They've loosened their control over the economy because, well, most of the Communists forgot the most important thing Marx said - Communism wouldn't happen until *post scarcity*. It was what followed *after* capitalism produced massive surplusses. China was an impoverished, peasant country with almost 0 infrastructure and 0 surplus production. They tried to skip the capitalist phase and jump straight from feudal to communist. It didn't work for the Soviets and it didn't work for China. So, while they still hold the Communist ideal and are working for it *sometime in the future*, right now they're going back and building up the surplusses *required* by Marx. That's how one can ideologically justify China's ""capitalist"" bent and still argue quite reasonably that they are communist.",7,1530717595.0
t3_8whexk,e1vwbpx,"If you accept the existing rules of the WTO and norms of neoliberalism, China is breaking quite a few. 

Their subsidies to corporations are definitely more-so against WTO than other countries. They are more protectionist and commonly have individualized and politicized policy toward corporations, including putting more regulation on foreign companies than Chinese. They tacitly allow IP theft and have been known to allow Chinese importers to cheat American companies. Whether all this has been systemically designed by Beijing or just weak bureaucracy in a massive country has been debated. But, really no one would think much of it if it wasn't for the size, very similar to Japanese re-industrialization waves in the '70s and 80's.


The devaluing of the currency (done *prior* to trump's campaign) is a good example. No one really bats an eye when smaller economies do something similar. Much of these bending of the rules and norms had been tacitly accepted as a means to develop, since Washington Consensus has failed. So, on one hand China is so large it causes a structural shift no matter what, and on the other is China past the development level to give such allowances? 


Politicians have to simplify issues for the average voter, so someone looking for a change in this relationship may say simple things about trade balance to get them on side, but trump is using this rhetoric on all states he perceives to ""win"" at a trade balance. Canada and the EU have marginally higher tariffs and subsidize goods more, but this is all literally marginally.


So, trump appears, and from the description that other politicians give over their experience with him, is just about the trade balance. He legitimately appears to have a short-term and simplistic understanding of the situation. This is probably the best case scenario.

The worst is that he understands the complexities of trade, but has zero understanding of diplomacy. With Canada the deals originally incorporated mild protections from getting swamped by US megacorporations. Like Europe, this generally leaned toward things like agriculture, cultural industries, or strategic such as aerospace. The US does this too, but Canada and the EU are marginally higher. trump may think he can successfully bully them into lowering them (perhaps lower than ours). In reality, more standardization, including tariffs and customs, need to be done in trade negotiation. This is a big risk with little payoff, and little chance of success unless you believe trump has amazing skills.

The worse yet is that trump may want to end trade interdependence and replace it with dependence; for states he can't do that he is happy to see trade decrease. If you take this assumption his incomprehensible babbling about deficits and getting ripped off begin to make sense. He takes a ""vulgar realist"" stance on the zero-sum game principle; one state is necessarily ripped off the other, as indicated by the balance. If we have a negative balance we're being ripped off; we can't end this, but we can reverse it. This is why the more rational and *possible* approach to standardized tariffs/subsidies of mutually beneficial negotiation is off the table--you cannot negotiate exploitation. 


If he isn't as incompetent as he is incomprehensible this may be why he doesn't discuss the dollar situation. The opposite of Germany gaining exports through a depressed Euro founded upon neighboring straining economies, much of the US trade deficit is due to the strength of the dollar being based as a global currency, opposed to the US economy. The dollar is so fundamental to the global economic system that I don't know how this could be addressed without ambitious and large changes, but it may be that this benefit has outlasted its cost at the current stage of the US decline and we need a more malleable currency. That this isn't discussed and the problem is rhetorically individualized to countries makes me think trump is seeking a means to ""have his cake and eat it too"" using unfair trade practices to make up for structural weakness, while retaining that same systemic power. If there were a time for such imperialism it would have been after WWII, and that is if there was not a cold war.


All these scenarios paint trump as a systemically dangerous idiot, but some more than others. The more pernicious interpretation does make his rhetoric make much more sense. This is also the more dangerous as there is no way in hell it is going to work, even if you wanted it to. 


On the other hand, he may simply make no long-term sense because he doesn't have any. He harps on concerns of Yuan manipulation years after the fact, he complains about Japanese and German cars decades after the fact... He seems to legitimately care about trade balances, rather than the nuances they imply and only adds other complexities into his rhetoric. He complains about Canadian tariffs and when people question why he doesn't bring up the much more important issue of subsidies, he starts tossing the word at the end ""we're very concerned with Canadian trade balance and tariffs, and subsidies are also very important"" in a manner that implies he's not overly familiar with the issue. 

At this point, what it comes down to in my analysis is what spectrum of incompetent and nefarious (unless you want US imperialism and think it is possible) is trump? I think people tend to assume you have to understand all the complexities and nuances of international economics and politics to develop the long-term strategy I detailed above. That is not true; you would only need that to succeed, were it even possible.


How to wrap your head around trump: do not try to read his rhetoric in ""peace, prosperity, and equality"", assume it is rhetorical pandering to his base, accept much of it is short-term attachments to the first two (added to the first and *used* for the second), and that much of it simply doesn't make sense--the more true the more long-term you analyze his ""strategy"".

The same people exporting (or manufacturing for export) are not necessarily the same people importing (or consuming imports), although some people are both to one extent or the other.  When your currency is worth less, that helps one but hurts the other. Ditto for tourism -- what helps draw people to a country (cheaper prices due to currency fluctuation) hurts your own people going overseas.  In addition, cheapening your currency harms savers (because their money buys less) but helps borrowers to some degree (if they can pay back in cheaper currency).

One approach that is sometimes popular would say ""cheapen your currency to increase exports"", but ignores all the countervailing damages -- and this is sometimes successful because neither the good nor the bad are equally distributed, and/or because one side is more politically powerful or persuasive than the other.

t3_9e3pgy,e5lwpdj,"> This causes exponential run-ups in price, until the price of whatever asset it is, reaches a high that is just ""too risky for investors"" and then the appreciation stops... At that point, investors decide to sell, but sadly, most of the demand for the asset was investors, so, when they all decide to sell, there is no one to buy, and the price plummets...

It's actually worse than this (and none of what you have ""discovered"" is new or unknown).

Most ""investors"" (returns seekers, rentier capitalism, whatever you want to call it) are actually buying these ""equity"" assets on margin and when the asset price goes down, their broker (the ones lending them the money) executes a margin call, which either requires them to add more money to their account (and let's face it, if they had the money in the first place, they woudn't need to borrow from their broker) or have some of their assets sold off to pay back their loan or at least interest on the loan.  This is what creates the non-optional downward pressure to sell off assets that have otherwise been ""good investments"".

So, dominant paradigm for the generation of returns involve two mechanisms:

1 - paying dividends

2 - asset price growth

Stocks that pay dividends are typically ""boring"" and are generally ""out of ideas"" about how to grow their business.  The consequence is that they face the prospect of being forced out of their dividend producing business sector by competition and innovation.  Thus, the biggest risk these companies face (and by extension, their shareholders) is that of dividend reduction or elimination due to their profit margin being eroded (by competition and innovation).

The second mechanism, asset price growth, is far more complicated.  At its most basic level this is the ""voting machine"" model of the equities market combined with the idea of realizing gains by ""finding a greater fool"" to buy your shares from you.  This is modulated by a company's ability to split stocks, issue more shares, take on corporate debt and issue stock buy-backs.  There are two threats to this model, the first of which is simply supply and demand (more people wanting out of their positions than to get into a position; see the previous bit about margin calls).   The second threat is that of dilution.  Basically, when a company issues more shares, they're in competition with their shareholders for ""finding the greater fool"".

Currently, due to low interest rates, dividend issuance has dropped to a hundred basis points or so above the prime rate (stuck around 2% right now).  The consequence is that the vast amount of returns seeking has moved into the asset appreciation mechanism which requires the use of margin leverage to be fully exploited.  The margin call pressures that exert whenever asset prices decline is modulated primarily via share buy-backs (yet another feedback look primarily caused by overseas capital repatriation and the fact that most boardsitter compensation happens via stock issuance).

The question everyone should be asking themselves is:

When does margin call forced selling overwhelm stock buy-back price action modulation?

A couple of reasons. Firstly, they relied far too heavily on oil. Before the collapse, oil made up 95% of exports. When oil prices came tumbling down due to US shale, the foundation for their economy was eroded away.


Another problem was the appropriating of private assets by the government. Entire businesses were seized, and a government puppet was put in charge. Needless to say, they had no idea how to run a competitive company but could rely on government wealth to keep them running.


Yet another problem was the government’s response to these problems. When their income from oil started running dry, they doubled down and threw more subsidies at the oil industry. In fact at the current prices, a single US dollar is enough to fill up your car 700 times. That is obviously absurd.

In order to pay for these subsidies, the government had to print more money since they couldn’t afford it in the budget. This led to hyperinflation and the huge crisis we have today.


To combat hyperinflation, the government decided to use price controls. While it technically succeeded since no shops could sell goods at increased prices, it had the obvious side effect that shops had to make a massive loss for every sale and thus closed, leading to mass shortages of every item.",20,1545660762.0

> Is it that far fetched to fear another bubble (e.g. student loans?)

I keep seeing people say this. Student loans are not going to affect the economy ala 2008. They will be a drag on the economy since people will be putting money towards those instead of buying a new house or other things. It will be a perpetual drag, so nothing good, but it won't be like a bubble pop. Student loans are backed by the government, so if you default your wages get garnished instead. With few exceptions, you are gonna be on the hook for them one way or another.

> How could a recession then affect recent graduates, incoming students, and/or the general public?

Like any other recession, there will be, at the very least, hiring freezes at many places. Others will downsize and go bankrupt as well. This means that those who have more experience in their field and are well-connected will have first dibs on things like ""entry-level"" positions that a college grad would normally take. This means that a significant portion of graduates will be unemployed upon graduation. In 2008-2011 at the university I went too, job offers after college were frequently rescinded for those who had them, career fairs had less turnout among employers, etc.

As for other groups, it's kinda early to tell at this point. We will see how the next recession will pan out. Some industries tend to fare better than others (ex. hospitality always takes bigger hits since people tend to not go on vacation when they are worried about the economy while government jobs or certain other areas are typically more stable in comparison, etc.). 

I do not know how mild or severe the next recession will be. To put things in perspective, U6 unemployment during the last recession did peak at around 17% (or 10% if you go by U3). Unemployment right now is just under 4% last I checked.

EDIT: I will add that a lot of people are living paycheck-to-paycheck. I would imagine that those who lose their jobs during a recession who made a low wage and can't stretch their budget any further will feel the brunt of it.",2,1546210465.0
t3_abhrk2,ed0kakk,"Major corporations were given low-interest loans following 2008 in order to keep them afloat. In some cases the state took ownership of a portion of the corporation, and in many of those cases did not intervene in the board of directors, but acted as a silent partner. The reason is because these corporations were large enough to be systemically important to the economy--the have them go bankrupt would put so many people out of the job, harm other businesses dependent on them (especially for the banks), and likely lead to a depression.

State Capitalism originally referred to a state run economic system whereby the state both leads investment and management, as well as receives the gains. This was usually used as a criticism of nominally socialist, centrally planned economies that did not have worker control--i.e. they were state capitalist rather than socialist.

Since the cold war, two trends have been led by China and the US, of which I assume Chomsky and Varoufakis are referring to (the context would be useful as it sounds they are using the term loosely). One is the liberalization of the Chinese centrally planned economy; the other is the monopolization of a competitive economy. The result of both (China creating a plutocracy; and the US evolving into one) is a system of politically powerful elites and businesses, of which the state will cater to over the population. In the sense of the bailout is creating a system that is dependent on massive corporations, and keeping them afloat when they fail.

The use of State Capitalism in reference to things like the bailout is likely used more as a hyperbolic criticism than as an actually descriptive term. This is to remove the idea that markets and the state are separate, as you mentioned, and rather than there is a propensity for elites to use both the state and economic system to their benefit. 

The criticism of separating market and politics is that 1) the market is inherently a political sphere, and thus not something that can be left alone and only reacted to. It is also shaped by politics and thus laissez-faire ideologies have ulterior motives. 2) because the state will inevitable become intermixed with the market, it is required to preempt concentration of market and economic power (some form of Socialism for Chomsky, at least social democracy for Varoufakis, and probably Keynesianism at the least) or else there will be the inevitable evolution to ""state capitalism"" as they are apparently calling it.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing as even though you would be numerically dilute, the shares would be accretive in value.

t3_alayfg,efddmdr,"Hi el\_muchacho, this is an interesting point of view. I have not heard this proposed before. Here are a few reasons I see why the system is as it is:

* Investing in a company is in competition with other investments, like bonds or putting your money in a savings account. Similarly to the savings account, where earned interest will generate interest itself, any money you leave in the company will generate more money for you. If you cap this, people will have much less incentive in creating a company and simply put their money in bonds of into a savings account. This will reduce overall growth.
* If you enforce your system, the founder will have no reason to keep the money in the company. Every year he will simply pay out all the gains as dividends, and the company will grow less and be less successful. With those dividends he can then create another company, with the same limitations. So such a system would again severely hamper growth.
* The risk of a founder is not only the initial stake. As the company grows, he decides to not take out gains and keep them in the company. Hence he increases his stake every year. This is like if he made a new investment into his company every year. Hence he should be rewarded for it.

t3_b8rw00,ek15km2,"> When the next downturn hits could the US reversal of these trade wars not do a better job of stimulating the economy then say QE? 

Probably not, as the reversal of the trade wars are mostly tariff reductions whose funds would be offset by increase in savings via t-bills or more imports. Some consumption is likely to occur but nothing likely significant enough to end the recession, whose causes might stem from other sources (malinvestment, politics or natural disasters).

>  Is the potential of reversing these wars not another tool in the US arsenal against a difficult downturn? 

I wouldn't describe foreign trade regulations as stimulus tools; tariffs and capital controls are typically used for preventative measures against real and monetary drains on a nation's economy. So, no.

> With the fed controlling interest rates, would the introduction of a trade war prior to a recession and the withdrawal from said war not have a similar effect on the economy as the rising and lowering of interest rates? 

This depends on the scope of such a trade war and the fed's attitude. Reducing foreign trade could open up room for domestic investment and inspire the fed to keep interest rates low; there must be some agent(s) who will fill in the space opened up by the loss of trade. If foreign trade is reengaged through the reversal of a series of policies, the fed may raise rates to slow inflation. TBH IMO, the expansion of a trade war will contract the economies and vice-versa; trade wars occurs to damage a foreign economy and/or reducing the damage the domestic economy is suffering. But ultimately a trade war will require the domestic economy to pay its pound of flesh.

If your goal is to simulate the economy before a recession and avoid the use of QE, don't get into a trade war to reverse it later. Prevent cash flows from ceasing and replace the ones that do.

I think the stock market is overvalued, and likely to produce a negative return over the next 5 years.  I think it's risky to try to time, but that current levels might be a good exit point, for now. I think a significant stock market decline could also put some pressure on consumer spending, and might itself be an indicator, but it's again hard to say when that might actually occur.  

I think housing is only slightly overvalued, but at this time may be as likely to go higher as lower. In the short run, I see some slowing. But once the economy does start to falter, and interest rates are cut, I expect that would juice the housing market some. So I think housing remains a relatively good investment over the next 5 years. 

I like the current returns (around 2.35%) available in the money market, as a way to stay slightly ahead of inflation while waiting for better opportunities. In short, I do think assets are somewhat overvalued at the moment, but I don't think that this implies that there is any recession on the horizon.",2,1559068180.0
t3_bvim1t,eppgwer,"I assume precious metals will deflate again, that's what they did in 2008, and I don't think there's any reason they won't do it again.

Initially each time we have one of these events there's a scramble for cash, like in 2008.  When debt (a kind of money) is being destroyed due to counter-party and other risks, it drives the price of cash up because everyone is trying to get their hands on it and they'll sell anything to get it - that extra house they wanted to flip, the expensive 2nd car in the driveway they can't make payments on, .. and yes, even gold and silver, so they can cover their mortgage and other debts, so they don't lose their house or their primary mode of transportation.

That said ... I think we're well beyond reason here and that the end game is a currency collapse (worldwide), and that it'll happen just on the other side of the next deflationary event, so when the deflationary event happens I'll be looking to dump fiat before they finish destroying it.

Edit .. all of that said, gold and silver has never been worth nothing.  It's one of the few assets that has no counter-party risk.  Even real estate is technically a paper asset, because without a deed (which the government and courts can take whenever they want to) you don't own real estate.

Also I looked at Barrons which seems to have contradicting articles on the subject, so the short answer is nobody knows.

My personal experience would be probably yes, based on shopping. I've been shopping in department stores and malls for a long time (decades!) so it's not that hard to spot trends and the current trend looks bad to me. A lot of stores are closing and whole malls are being repurposed, but that's not the only thing. Stores like Macy's that sell the ""good stuff"" are selling it really really cheap. A shirt will have a list price of $50 but you pick it up on the sale rack at $8 and everything is on sale all the time. How can Macy's continue to operate at such a thin profit? I see them cutting personnel and cutting services. Half the dressing rooms are closed and the open ones are full of clothes that need to be put away and there is a line at the checkout counter.

t3_cxyuho,eyotwlw,">These characteristics sharply distinguish neoliberalism from the managed, welfare-state capitalism of the postwar era, which featured the expansive growth of the public sector in health care, education, social services, spending on infrastructure and research and development, demand-generating Keynesian economic policies (fiscal and monetary), support for labor rights and rigorous financial regulation (Kuttner, 2007). This period, which witnessed high growth rates and equitable prosperity, is often referred to as the Golden Age of U.S. capitalism.

That period was also the Golden Age of Neoliberalism. Investments in health care, education, social services, spending on infrastructure and research and development, in the postwar era, were some of the main distinguishing features of ""neoliberalism"" in that era, along with a government role in regulating markets in the public interest, to prevent the distortions of markets which resulted from excess corporate power and wealth inequity.  Neoliberalism from the 1930s into the postwar era was in significant part a reaction against the classical liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism which neoliberals believed had led to the Great Depression. 

>Neoliberalism emerged in the late 1970s (Stein, 2010) and was fully embraced by President Reagan in his policy agenda featuring large income tax cuts, deregulation of finance and conservative budget policies designed to reduce domestic program spending and increase funding for the military. 

That's more in line with classical liberalism, or what the neoliberals would have called ""paleoliberalism"".  It's not clear from this article why this isn't simply called ""classical liberalism"", which as the article notes is defined by a government primarily ""limited to contract enforcement, police protection, and defense against foreign threats."" 

If one believes these are the only legitimate roles of government, that naturally leads to support for reduced taxes, reduced spending on everything but defense and administration of justice, and even to privatization of most other functions. As well as to enhanced corporate power and oligopoly. The neoliberals would have called this ""paleoliberalism"". And the people who actually supported these policies in the US and Europe identified themselves with classical liberalism, not with ""neoliberalism"".  And some conservatives in the US even started to adopt the term ""libertarian"" because they believed the very word ""liberalism"" had so been corrupted by neoliberal belief in government regulation and social and welfare spending.",2,1567283249.0

In 2007 when the crisis was just starting to make itself apparent, gold prices actually began a steep rise ($800.32 Jan 2007 to $1,081.75 Jan 2008, or \~35%).  

The 2008 drop I mentioned was right around the largest DOW point drop in history (since replaced by some crazy drops in 2018-2019) and in response to a rejection of a bank bailout by congress.

Central banks do not create money, money is endogenous. So you're wrong there. Central banks influence liquidity levels in the money market by targeting the interbank lending rate using repurchase agreements. The money market involves discount securities, not bonds. The safest bonds are treasury debt securities, then you have riskier bonds which have higher yields but lower prices (the inverse relationship between bond prices and bond yields).

Not sure what to say here, GDP was never meant to be a measure of success, that's a normative perspective. Positively, GDP is simply the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a period of time.

Your starting premise is flawed.

The bonds issued by the central banks are the safest bonds in the world.  That's why the interest rates are so low.    
You can get corporate bonds that pay much high interest rates, but there is a reason they are known as junk bonds.

t3_ebb2rv,fb4cnk7,"Okay, I think there's quite a bit to unpack here. I'll try to make it simple.

First of all, what happens in an economy, given that we ignore the possibility of deferred consumption. Goods and services change hands. As a sidenote, if a company can't sell a product for greater than cost or a person can't buy one for equal what they see it's worth as, it doesn't change hands. Thus we can assume *all* goods and services provided change hands.

Or in other words, aggregate supply = aggregate demand.

In a basic model, you have three input factors, land, capital and labor. Land meaning not just land but natural resources, capital meaning non-perishable input factors, or things that don't ""go away"" when you use them, computers for example, or buildings, or machines.

The reason we generate ""value"" is that we combine those things to create something that's worth more. A pencil is more useful than a stick, a knife more useful than a piece of iron.

So let's say you have a very simple economy with two people, one person can make 10 fish a day, the other one can make 10 firewood a day. What's the output of the economy? Well, 10 fish and 10 firewood. What can they consume? 10 fish and 10 firewood. How that's distributed is a different question, maybe the one person is super cold all the time and will want to consume 7 firewood, maybe the other likes fish a lot, so they trade and one person ends up with 7 fish and 7 firewood and the other with 3 fish and 3 firewood. But that's not the question at hand, it's about total output/consumption, and this is basically how it works.

Where does money come in? Well, money is just a tool to make our lives easier. ""Just"", well of course an incredibly useful one, but not something that is strictly *necessary*.

So what's that money worth? The answer is 10 fish and 10 firewood. Because that's all you can buy. Why would money be worth more than what it can buy? This is called the [neutrality of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_of_money). It just *represents value*. Where that value *actually comes from* is the entire output of the economy.

That's also why it's basically irrelevant how much money there is, at least in the long run. The value of all money is just the value of all the output, it doesn't matter if there's 1000$ or 1$ for all of those 10 fish and firewood, it just means the numbers look different. This is also where inflation comes from. If the growth of the money supply is greater than the growth of the output, you get inflation.

Or in other words, a larger amount of money is chasing a smaller amount of goods, thus each unit of money is worth less.

Of course in the real world this is more complex, because you for example have the ability to shift consumption into the present/future. Creating lots of money and in turn lots of inflation would destroy savings, at least in the short term, and that would obviously be bad, for example.",2,1576506359.0

We're in uncharted waters cause most of the estimates are based on how China recovered from SARS, but that's a bad comparison since China had the 6th largest GDP in 2003, it's currently 2nd largest now. 

I'm running off memory right now, so figures are ball parked, but biggest near term impact is the huge drop in Chinese tourism. Hong Kong's retail market has fallen by 12% already (although a lot is protest related). Macau's getting hit hard and casino's are burning through 2-3MM a day in reserves to keep the lights on. 

With respect to supply chains, Hyundai already has idling plants in South Korea because they're short on wire harnesses they need to make cars. Smaller retail shops in the region are all reporting shortages in inventory because nothing is being exported so it's really only a matter of time before inventory runs out with larger companies. Idle manufacturing in China makes stuff worse for raw material exporting countries, Angola, Chile, Peru, Brazil, Columbia export large amounts to China for manufacturing purposes and those economies will get the hit in the medium term. 

Finally, the last industry to get hit (and probably the most important) will be the financial markets who underpin the economy. When companies fail, people lose jobs, when they lose jobs they can't service their debt. And China has a HUGE amount of debt. We're already seeing StandC and HSBC provide loan relief in HK (interest payments only) but it's only a matter of time before this extends to the broader Chinese FI's (the Big 5 are all among the largest 7 banks in the world).

Yet trumps numbers are worse and he started off in a much better spot than Obama did.  So careful with who claims what.  As far as things trump has done to make the economy ""great"" he hasn't.  He gave a massive tax cut to the richest humans on the planet who put it back into the stock market which doesn't help the majority of people, and the taxes are going to increase over time to cover the loss of all those tax dollars the rich was going to pay.  Those increased costs will fall on the backs of the middle class, followed by repubs saying taxation is bad and the push to cut social security and medicare.  Basically we traded SS and medicare for a massive gift to billionaires. He also has put a ton of tariffs on Americans.  We pay for tariffs, which is unfortunate for the middle class.  Also the massive bailouts for farmers.  If the economy was great why are we bailing out farmers?  Why even put tariffs on their products causing them to need a bailout?

The most common answer I see from trump supporters is ""he's removing regulations"" and the stock market.  I mean yeah we can get rid of some regulations and it might help the businesses but what will be the cost of deregulation?  Lets say trump allows companies to dump waste water in public waterways.  Great that company saves money but healthcare costs will increase, the public will have to pay to clean those waterways.  Deregulation sounds neat and all but it can also cost way more down the line  for the public while saving money for private companies over the short run.  My taxes will pay for deregulation.  I always look at poor people and dental care as an example.  If you can afford to get your teeth cleaned you will get less cavities.  So poor people might not get their teeth cleaned which saves money but their teeth now have holes.  And rather than needing a cheap cavity filled they now need 2 grand to get a root canal and cap.  Basically deregulation moves costs from companies to the backs of the public because inevitably our tax dollars will go towards cleaning their messes.  I agree over regulation can be harmful but a lot of times its just shifting costs from companies to the public.  ""Company A doesn't have to pay to have their water cleaned!  Hooray lets save money.""  ""Now my waterway is polluted and we need to spend more public money cleaning it or buying water from a new waterway.

With regard to how much money you'd make - the idea is that hospitals and clinics would get paid at current Medicare rates, which are 5% to 20% less than what traditional insurance companies pay out for procedures. So, there would be a reduction in income, however you would also be able to spend less on administrative costs. For large hospitals they could eliminate a huge number of administrative positions and save more money than what they lose with the reduced rates.

How that translates to you specifically depends on a variety of factors, like if you choose to open a private practice or work for a large hospital. If you're opening a private practice it's a business that needs staff, and you will be able to have less staff or have them work fewer hours if your business doesn't have to deal with a billion different insurance companies.

t3_fki932,fktdvi1,"UBI is not socialism at all. It is no different than the game Monopoly where you pass GO and receive a measly $200 for rounding the board. It stimulates the economy and keeps people in the game longer... just because people get $200 doesn’t mean they’re done playing the monopoly game. They’re eager to invest and buy more property. And nobody would ever describe the game Monopoly as socialist.

Socialism is when the government creates a large bureaucratic program that offers a service and/or tells *qualifying people* what they can and cannot do with something specific they can be eligible to apply for. Examples of socialist programs would be disability and food stamps. Disability because you only qualify if you prove you cannot work due to meeting qualifying conditions. Food stamps because they’re only for food and again, you have to qualify.

UBI on the other hand simply attempts to put cash into people’s hands to stimulate the economy. It has been described as capitalism that does not start at zero. If it has any ounce of socialism in it, then it’s the least socialist program of all socialist programs, because it does not tell people what they can do with the money. This is why UBI is considered a libertarian concept, perhaps it is like a form of libertarian socialism. 

We can debate night and day whether it will have unintended negative consequences, but all studies to my knowledge show only benefits if you put money directly into people’s hands and let them spend it how they want. Of course the point is you have to put just enough to help them — you don’t want to make everyone rich or yes they will get lazy and do nothing. That’s why proposals are usually around the poverty limit, like $1,000 a month in the US. It’s not enough to convince people to quit their jobs, but it will help them survive during a crisis like a pandemic. And believe me, if this does not happen, we are mere weeks away from riots and chaos as people start getting hungry. Better to implement a UBI now and keep the social order than watch society collapse.

If you want some resources on this issue, I highly recommend watching one of Andrew Yang’s talks. He was running for President up until recently, and championed the idea of the “Freedom Dividend” as a way to help people during the automation crisis we have already been in for decades. The coronavirus is only going to incentivize big business to automate away even more jobs now. Yang was ahead of his time but this pandemic may prove that he was right on time after all.

ps here is one of Yang’s older interviews. It’s outdated and he has modified some of his policy proposals to improve them, but I still think this sums up perfectly why a UBI is worth a shot and not such a crazy idea:

Review the actions of the Federal Reserve going back to September 2019 to the current date. 

The US has a debt problem. Huge. After the last financial downturn, the Federal Reserve left interest rates low and it needed to unwind its bloated balance sheet from Quantitative Easing. Inflation in the form wage push at the working class never materialized. Through low interest rates, everyone feasted on cheap credit. It was easier to refinance and no need to pay down debt. The US Federal Government has a debt problem. The debt to GDP ratio exceeds 100%. Putting that amount in perspective, the last time the country debt to GDP ratio exceeded 100% was WWII. We're not in a world war. Instead of paying down the debt and/or reducing the deficit after the last financial downturn, we reduced taxes in a supply push economic policy instead of a demand push economic policy. EU member countries have roughly a 60% debt to GDP ratio. We wouldn't qualify for being a EU member nation without a combination of tax increases and budget cuts. But starving the Federal Government budget would cause a short term economic decline and cutting the budget or raising taxes isn't politically popular. 

Prior to September 2019 what did we witness? Bond yield inversion. The first sign that the financial markets were signaling that the economy wasn't right. The first sign that people were already full on bonds. 

September 2019. The Repo market or overnight lending window that makes overnight loans between banks driven by companies seeking a short term loan to make payroll etc almost locked up. The repo market is traded in UST US Treasuries. The problem was despite banks meeting capital requirements, they were short on cash to meet demand of the short term loan. The interest rate spiked nearly to 10%. With limited cash, and UST acting as collateral, the interest rate was threatening to go up quickly. The spread was quickly separating on what is supposed to be the world's most liquid paper. Enter the Federal Reserve to the rescue! The Federal Reserve stepped in and offered to essentially be a lender of last resort. So kind. But self serving. The target rate for interest rates had been set by the Federal Reserve to 2.5% and injected liquidity. Meaning the Federal Reserve offered to buy $50 billion dollars of UST nightly in the Repo market. Let's put that in perspective. The first round of QE was an astonishing $600 billion. Assuming that amount was met nightly, QE1 was accomplished by October 2019. Since then the Federal Reserve slowly and without much fanfare increased the amount from $150 billion to $175 billion what two weeks ago? The last amount was $1 trillion. Plus a fresh round of QE, plus elimination of bank reserve requirements. Why? Because not just UST but municipal bonds and corporate bond market. 

Take oil drillers. Their bonds were issued when the spot price of oil was higher. It was unthinkable that oil would touch $20. Now those investment grade corporate bonds are stinky junk. 

Municipal bonds. Issued when the economy was doing well. Unthinkable that a massive economic downturn that would shutter so many businesses. Tax receipts are down. Suddenly Muni bonds look like stinky junk. 

If in the long term you expect inflation to kick in, no one wants to hold the bond. Sell sell sell. But few people want to buy. Cash is King! 

So if everyone is looking to dump bonds only the Federal Reserve is buying to the tune of trillions. 

Fire up the printing press! Print money! Lots of money! But more money in circulation with contracting GDP causes inflation! If the target inflation number that the Federal Reserve artificially imposed on the country for so long with low interest rates hadn't happened, the debt bubble it created wouldn't be popping! If the Federal Government had paid down debt and applied a demand driven economy we might be in a different situation. Too much money printing without GDP can cause not just inflation later on but hyperinflation.

So if all that money is being printed why the dollar surge? Because at the moment, in the short term cash is King.

The corona virus has dropped demand for services and many but not all goods. That drop in aggregate demand drops prices, which is deflationary. However, because nobody is making stuff, at home or as imports, supply has greatly dropped, which is inflationary. There is a lot less stuff available, so you get shortages and higher prices. Go to Walmart and see all the half-empty shelves.

Now, the flood of oil will drop energy prices which will offset the price increases caused by shortages. BUT, if few people are working, few people are using energy for cars or to make stuff, so costs of production go even lower, and some if those lower costs lower the prices. BUT, since global production has dropped so much, the supply shock will more than offset energy cost reductions. So the net result will be probably turn out to be inflationary - especially after the shale oil producers go out if business thus driving energy prices back up.

On top of all that, the treasury and the fed will be sending everyone cash when few people are producing anything.

So the nation will have lots more cash chasing fewer goods and services , lower productivity, lower levels of production, fewer businesses remaining in business, more restrictions, and eventually fewer oil producers remaining profitable.

t3_ft8c08,fm6p9r7,"So are you talking about stagflation or hyperinflation, because those are two very different things.

I don't think the US has a large risk of hyperinflation since most debt is sovereign and Eve actually been struggling to keep inflation up. However while we will likely see some deflation as the economy moves into a deep recession, we'll also probably see stagflation on the other side caused by oil prices increasing again and little increase to real compensation.

Tl;Dr:  The US is struggling to keep rates up and most people live paycheck to paycheck. If people don't have enough money to spend you can't have hyperinflation no matter how much money exists.",3,1585799527.0
t3_ft8c08,fm964qr,"Inflation, deflation, stagflation, hyperinflation. 

Multiple terms. Federal Reserve over time tinkered with the rate of inflation calculation, changed weighted values on inputs, then moved to chain calculation in an attempt to smooth price fluctuations by reported periods. The result might just be a noticeable lag in values presented depending on regional perspective due to supply in the short term.

Deflation in some durable goods initially as inventory will need to convert to cash with no demand. Someone else did a nice job explaining supply, manufacturing, oil and demand. Perhaps a wash overall in inflation rate short term.

We are in a Recession globally, per IMF and likely to remain in a period of economic stagnation should Coronavirus hang around. Even if by a miracle it was solved tomorrow and no one had Coronavirus in the world, never to return it will likely be months if not years before a complete recovery as supply chains will change. 

Therefore going with stagflation, or economic stagnation, with potentially rising prices and stubborn long lasting unemployment issues resulting toward the end of the year and lasting a period of potentially years based on the current understanding that there's no cure and vaccination for Coronavirus and without meaningful social distancing or quarantine Coronavirus will potentially be around awhile.

Hyperinflation not as likely at least in the next few years. While true that money printer is going brrrr, in theory money supply could increase, but without demand there's no price. If no exchange of money transactions price falls apart. MV=Py, where 

M = money supply

V = Velocity of money

P = price

Y = consumers demand

Hyperinflation is driven by inflation, money printing, bonds issued, currency exchange. 

Not over looking increase in money printing and bonds issued here in US. But without demand, no price. USD still remains strong. Global economy went simultaneously in recession. Government and central banks simultaneously turned the money printer on in an attempt to prevent Financial collapse and hopefully prevent an economic collapse. Each country was hit with a one two punch of supply and demand shock, a bazooka cannon of liquidity, creating variables of economic impact, shifts in supply chain, rates of recovery pushing demand and thus inflation and interest rates in each country. 

When the US sneezes economically, the rest of the world catches a cold is still true. But the US and the world will at some point need to examine what happened to safeguard and strengthen the economy that will take years to work itself out.

2-If you let the companies fall, the short term effects will be a lot worse. It takes time, effort and money for new businesses to take their place, worsening the recession/depression and making the recovery harder as we wait for all these industries to be rebuilt.

And for what? Some people seem to think smaller and more efficient businesses will take their place but I have no idea why people think that. Its not like people have much capital during this time to create small startups, the guys who are gonna have the capital are the big billionaires who were rich enough to be able to take the hit and they aren't in the business of small startupsm And its not as if the pandemic is hitting inefficient businesses, its hitting both efficient and inefficient businesses.

In fact, the few businesses that do survive because they've somehow had the foresight to hoard a massive rainy day fund are probably gonna be inefficient if anything as they probably were in the first place to hoard all that money without reinvesting any of it and now they have an even larger incentive to continue doing so. That's not efficient business activity.

t3_g6clgv,foaij4b,"IMF already declared that the world is in economic recession with 170 countries experiencing Economic GDP contraction this year. The speed of the one two punch in supply and demand shock is unprecedented. The Federal Government with the bailout attempted to save the largest corporations and financial institutions. The PPP loan program exhausted money as banks loaned out money to the larger small businesses. I know a number of small business owners that have less than 25 employees that have been in business for decades that didn't get any assistance. 90% of business is small business in the US. The paltry small distribution check issued to individuals will not be sufficient to for any length of time. Roughly half of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck before Coronavirus and without an income stream the demand curve for everything non essential and even essential items will be under pressure. See oil, food, housing. The thinking at the time when the Federal Government passed the stimulus bills was Coronavirus would be a temporary speed bump lasting two weeks perhaps a month given how other countries handled the situation. A full lock down of everything never happened across the US. Now there's discussion of attempting to reopen by region but this is short sighted. The whole point of social distancing and quarantine was to reduce the curve of cases to prevent the medical system from being overwhelmed. The economy is not an electric light switch where suddenly everything is back to normal. The economy is like a steam engine that requires time for the engine to heat up enough steam to turn the wheels. Everything is principally determined by Coronavirus and how society deals with the virus. Then once under some type of control, the economy could take months to years before returning. A recession is defined as two quarters of contracting GDP or six months whereas a depression is thought of as lasting perhaps two years with significant unemployment rate, in the Great Depression unemployment spike to almost 25%. 

Assumptions about how fast Coronavirus is solved impacts the speed of economic recovery. Time frame is calculated from February 2020 start date as this was the beginning of the virus impact in the US.

1. COVD19 cure and vaccination is found today, distributed globally tomorrow. The one two punch of supply and demand shock will take months if not years to return the economy back to normal. 
Probability outcome of COVD19 dissapearing tomorrow is 0%

2. A ""cure"" treating symptoms of more severe cases is being looked at using any existing medication and rushed through trial testing. Maybe it's possible to reduce deaths and reduce the most severe cases clogging hospitals. The right combination of medication is discovered to control severe symptoms and is readily available by end of year. A vaccination candidate is being rushed through trial testing. Typically it can take years for a vaccination but news media has been pitching the hope a vaccination can be found and in 18 months, but then there's distribution issues that take time. It could be years before the economy recovers. Probability outcome 33%

3. Cure is found to address severe symptoms and available by year end but supply chain will be under pressure to deliver to meet demand. There have been multiple prior strains of Coronavirus, but to date no vaccination has ever been discovered for any previous strain of Coronavirus due to the nature of the virus in how it mutates. No vaccine is found because of how it mutates. A seasonal return with High transmission rate and mortality rate. It will take years for the economy to recover. Probability of outcome 33%

4. Cure is found to address severe symptoms and available by year end but supply chain will be under pressure to deliver to meet demand. There have been multiple prior strains of Coronavirus, but to date no vaccination has ever been discovered for any previous strain of Coronavirus due to the nature of the virus in how it mutates. No vaccine is found because of how it mutates. The virus mutates into a less lethal format similar to the common cold. It will be years before the economy recovers. Probability of outcome 33%

Not happy with my assumptions and probability? That's fine. Create your own assumptions about how Coronavirus is resolved along with the speed the economy recovers. My probability of time frame of speed of recovery is lengthen the longer Coronavirus sticks around. Already we find economic nationalism being expressed to move supply chains closer. In the US the idea is expressed with moving all medical supply production back to the US as a matter of national security. Japan is offering incentives for all Japanese Companies to move their manufacturing out of China back to Japan. How supply chains are rearranged during and after Coronavirus will have an impact on global distribution chains and global trade.

We have a consumer driven economy.  Normally 70% of GDP is the consumer spending money, in 2019 it was near 90%.

If you have a business with employees that are not working it would be easy to lose some to other better opportunities while you are shut down, even if they are getting paid. Even if you can find new hires you have a loss of institutional knowledge that may be irreplaceable and cause a business failure.

- it always lost its value, it is just that for our generation it did it only for assets and not wage, if you have to pay 1 M for a house that costs 300k 20 years ago it's inflation and ""money losing it's value"" same for education/ wall street. Some improvements of productivity linked to those assets may explain the jump in price, but I'm highly doubtful it explains everything. Today j pow decided that he will go in second gear, so we might see some inflation, but it's nothing new and any not sketchy asset should follow it. Here you can be long gold if you want, but I don't really like that type of investment as it's not really productive... but if ya want to more or less follow inflation do it. 

-As I see it hyperinflation is a place nobody wants to be in, it serves absolutely no purpose for anybody in the fed. Some relatively hard inflation might happen, but once again it's nothing new, just a phenomenon that didn't happen right in front of ou eyes since a long time, hell if it happens it will help you buy a house or a degree. For now inflation is contained in the ""financial sphere "" but I really hope it comes back tu use normal folks because it means that you don't have to pay your debt fully ( big shortcut here but it's true) 

- Do I have to go survivalist? I'm not sure, if you think it's truly the end of the world go for it, but I don't think it's a wise investment... and paying for shit right now is not a investment, sure if you look at it in terms of buying power and hyperinflation it's interesting, but it won't produce anything. If you want to go on a spending spree, look at some things that: 1- can produce other things; 2-does not lose there value; 3- you might learn something from. I'm thinking used tools of any kind sewing machine or wood cutter, wrench hammer any tool that you can produce with as it hold its value and let you create some. Books on a trade/ economics / sociology it will let you understand the world better.

-Investing is a bitch right now, if you think there will be a famine, invest in farm/agro stocks. If you think everything will be back to normal, invest in tourism stocks (highly fucking risky). If you think there will be a reopening but not back to normal, industry stuff ""blueships "". 

-There is a liquidity crisis right now, but papa j pow is explaining to everyone that 1+1=2.01 so it might go right and be contained in the financial sphere, as I don't see the big boys that receive those ""help"" go and buy a lot of things or pay higher wages to their middle of the road workers. 

I always saw crypto as an echo chamber, be wary of it... 

You are young, and don't have have anything, if this really is a liquidity crisis, it will be at the advantage of the buyer. Think of a way to work and buy a house, or buy assets.

Agree with the other person though that suggested visiting another thread. R/Economics 

Also try to focus on one topic question at a time. Glad that you have an interest in Economics and the dismal science. Never too late to change degree majors. Having a solid understanding of Economics will serve you well in life. My degree is Business Administration and took macro, micro, and price theory economics. Thought about majoring in Economics or Finance, but in the end acquired a B.S. B.A. 

The history leading up to the formation of the Federal Reserve is interesting. The individuals behind the push for the creation lead to interesting insights. 

Money itself is nothing more than a store of value. Over time, the representation has changed. Initially, barter happened. But barter is cumbersome. In a perfect world one could exchange an item for another, but that led to problems. Then objects and metal were used to represent an alternate form of barter. Shells, lumps of metal, then melting and stamped metal coins. Gold represented an agreed upon format, but was bulky, heavy and cumbersome to carry around. Oh and the problem of stealing it as well. Thus the need to place it somewhere ""safe."" Now there's a need to guard it and pay workers. But how much is in the safe? Need paper to represent the amount that way you don't need to carry all the gold around. People see the paper and believed that the gold was in a safe. Eventually the convenience of paper was found to be more convenient. But what if the guards had been really stealing it the whole time or someone else is printing paper that says they have gold but don't? Uh oh. If everyone went to exchange the paper for gold, the actual physical amount of gold may not actually exist and the game would be over. Gotta change the rules. Let's see hmm. The paper is backed by the Government itself, just believe that the gold is there. Same for silver. Gotta end gold and silver certificates where everyone can suddenly show up and exchange the paper for metal.  How about remove the gold and silver certificate label designation, and base money on a fiat debt based instrument. This is where ""This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private."" Translation, it's an IOU backed by the US Federal Reserve, a quasi public private institution. Not subject to audit. Money being printed might cause inflation, gotta now beat the rate of inflation. Enter the modern miracle of finance and financialization to try to do one thing, beat the rate of inflation to acquire wealth. 

The paper is nothing more than a store of value that can be used to invest in other stores of value. The definition of what money is changed again with computers and digital numbers that flash across a screen with no paper involved. Stocks at one time were all traded with paper. A messy affair. Just try to get an actual printed stock certificate today. If you did have an actual printed stock certificate, attempting to get it back in circulation becomes messy. 

Just as printed stock certificates have become all but obsolete, cash itself will be obsolete. The actual percent of the population using cash is decreasing. 

Heated debate might arise as to what the next accepted format of currency exists in a cashless world, and what to base the store of value on, GDP, crypto, block chain, etc but money all fundamentally comes down to an acceptable agreed upon form of exchange of value even if it's nothing more than electronic numbers on a screen. As long as people believe it has a store of value and readily exchanged in a market, then it is accepted. 

History says those that fail to remember their history are doomed to repeat it. Some really good history lessons and economic lessons in understanding currency and how currency has changed even in the US since the initial formation. Multiple currencies floated around at one time. An examination of world history how too much money was printed leading to hyperinflation is an interesting read. Financial investing says past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future success and all investment carries risk.

So then what is the money today? My opinion is a chart. Being able to read a chart is the real money today. Pick one, metal, currency, equity, bonds, commodities, etc. If you can read a chart, that is the money sitting on a screen.

I think the debt increase has been needed to support economic growth. With out the debt increases, the economy would have fallen into recession years ago or would have taken a long time to get out of the one from 08. 

Two problems with using government debt to prop up your economy. First, it provides small and decreasing economic growth. Because yields drop, decreasing marginal returns provide smaller and smaller returns over time, so over time people invest less in the economy, and much of the investment goes into high risk financial assets.

Eventually, the returns from government spending becomes zero. Then, even high risk financial assets are disliked. Those companies earnings drop to a point they must suspend the dividends. With out dividends, stock prices fall.

At this point government's must spend even more just to maintain stagnation. It's like running in a treadmill. But the problem gets worse now. As government's sharply increase spending to prevent falling off the treadmill, they risk spending more than the country is producing. As productivity falls and spending increases, inflation sets in.

t3_gq3u0g,frqm1v1,"Pretty accurate. I went to school with a good economics program and my professor in a finance-economics course taught what had happened in 2008, after which I watched the movie which repeated the same explanation in a stylized fashion.

MBS's (mortgage backed securities) and CDO's (collateralized debt obligations) were created to fabricate the appearance of low default rates since they use mortgages from different geographical locations that appear to not correlate. How could a mortgage from Louisiana correlate with a mortgage in New York? On top of that, CDO's were created out of existing CDO's to further ""diversify"" the investment vehicle and create the appearance of low risk and low correlating default rates. This created the problem of excessive speculation with people borrowing money from the housing market because mortgages were cheap (low interest rate) due to high investor demand on MBS's and CDO's. Thus you got this cycle of investors and borrowers feeding off each other while investment banks and rating agencies collected commissions as the movie portrays with the Asian banker from Morgan Stanley and the elderly woman from Fannie-May/Freddie-Mac. In reality, the default rates were understated, and when one geographic area of mortgages defaulted, they sent a ripple effect to all the other investment vehicles they were connected to.

As a caveat, CDO's and MBS's are generally a good thing from a math and economics standpoint because you want to encourage investment into these markets so that a growing population or newly developing area is able to afford cheaper mortgages. In theory, the diversification does in fact lower the rate of default on the instrument to the investors, even if individual mortgages may default. Banks restock their lending reserves by selling these financial instruments in order to fund more mortgages on the market. They essentially buy the house for the mortgagor until the mortgager makes all the monthly payments or pays the mortgage off entirely in one payment if the contract allows them to.

Unfortunately, when enough mortgages start defaulting, that puts the bank  on the line and the bank must answer the investors who are awaiting their payments obligated by the CDO's and MBS's that the investors purchased. And when there are layers of these financial instruments, there's a domino or jenga effect (as the movie portrays) where multiple classes of investors are unable to receive the money their owed from the banks, and the banks have to be bailed out by congress due to their own moral hazard.

t3_grr5lz,fs0ljvt,"Uh, yeah. You do know why exactly the population ballooned to 8 billion people right? Its because the industrial revolution caused a massive increase in productivity that allowed the population to increase to that point. In fact, that increase in productivity outpaced our population growth so much that even with 8 billion people, we're living in a state of luxury that the people of 200 years ago literally couldn't even dream of. Yet we're doing all this in spite of our ""dwindling resources"".

The problem with these types of arguments is that they generally ignore 2 things. Productivity increases and a decrease in population growth. Yes resources are limited, but it doesn't really matter if productivity gains can make up for it and believe me, they can make up for it. Technology has been increasing at an absolutely rapid rate allowing us to use resources more and more efficiently, discover new resources and resource types to use and to some degree reuse the resources we have previously used effectively making them new resources. 

Now this assumes that productivity or more accurately technology will always be increasing at such a rate that it can cover our consumption levels. Maybe one day we will reach a point where technology can't increase anymore, there are no new resources to find, no more new techniques to develop. That day however is likely to not be anytime soon, I don't think there's really any evidence to suggest we've hit a technological brick wall. And the fundamental resources we do have right now seem like they can still last a while or already have viable alternatives that can be developed further so they are unlikely to run out in the near future. Of course its hard to imagine even with such technological growth it could continously prop our ballooning population but this brings me to my second point.

Global population growth rates has been decreasing for a while. Its not going to balloon to 20 billion or 30 billion or so. In fact, some estimates estimate we will peak in 50 years or so and not even hit 10 billion. Imagine that, from going from 1 billion to 8 billion to 200 years to going from 8 billion to 9 billion in 50 years. After that, it is likely population growth will decrease further helping the problem. Combine this with our exponentially advancing technology and its hard to really see unsustainability due to limited resources being that major an issue.",2,1590611647.0

Businesses too stop expanding and saving money. They may lay people off who will save money and reduce spending. Because the banks aren’t creating money through as many loans and people aren’t spending money, or perhaps as businesses are going bankrupt and people aren’t paying their bills, this creates deflation. 

In order to fight deflation the fed discounts the cost of loaning money to encourage money creation and loans and Congress engages in stimulus to encourage spending. 

In an economy with inflation people are encouraged to spend as their money today will be worth less tomorrow. However when there is deflation people stop spending because their money is worth more tomorrow than it is today. So fear really has nothing to do with not spending money. But between inflation and deflation, deflation is far far far worse for the economy. When folks aren’t buying stuff it grinds to a halt. I hope inflation is stronger! So does the Fed!

3. Ambition/Skill/Training - go look at the difference in unemployment rates between those with a GED and those with a Masters degree. If your level of skill can be learned by anyone in less than a week you are going to have a hard time. On the flip side if you want to become a doctor you need 8 years of school then 3-7 years of residency. Now compare a doctors salary to the guy working at fast food. Now if you have no skill but you have ambition you can go get higher education. If you cant get education, you can go get some training on how to be a welder/plumber/ AC repairman which all pay much better if you are willing to put in the work.

The 50 activities the kids are in add up to astronomical figures.  
5. Stupidity - some people make tons of money but spend it and buy things on credit faster than they make it. Lots of people are paying for crazy expensive cars etc.  This is the people making over $100k who can't pay their bills.

6. Luck - who your parents are etc. Some people say you can make your own luck and this is true to an extent, but the overcomer is more exception rather than the rule.  

Now add all this up - the single person got a masters degree makes over $100k has not kids, pays all their debts off, work matches retirement savings 100%. Bought a house 10 years ago on a fixed rate mortgage. Basically every year that goes by they make more and builds wealth. Eventually gets married and has 1 kid, now they cant save as much but still has a good life. If they lose their job they can get another easily due to their job skills. 

Now the 2 kids on minimum wage at the local restaurant have 4 kids, credit card debt, one parent stops working, no education no savings. They don't own their home so rent goes up every year. Even if they realize their mistakes and want to go back to school, it is 100 times harder with kids. Basically this family is set for decades of pain.

Between February and may we saw extreme contractions in gdp. This is why we saw little inflation from the printing of money as in the equation above velocity decreased as people try to reign in unnecessary spending. Should economic activity resume like normal we generally see a like for like change in increase in money supply and inflation. However as long as gdp is contracting and velocity is decreasing we can avoid inflation by keep increasing money supply.

t3_hgmatz,fw50ka5,"Not to get too dystopian here, but I think it’s best to look at the history of other failed states and underdeveloped nations. 

I think an obvious trend that is already forming but will grow exponentially is moving in with family and living in multigenerational households. Moving in with someone who owns capital can allow all money coming in to be diverted to food and other goods that can be shared amongst the household as one or many members search for work or work precarious jobs. 

A more extreme example is a country like Brazil where an entire second economy developed in the form of favelas. Precarious housing set up by the people with their own systems for electricity, policing, and self-sufficient economy. It would essentially be like a mutation of the CHAZ or CHOP that is happening in Seattle right now, but on a multigenerational scale. The government would essentially “let go” of certain areas of major metropolitan cities, and the homeless and unemployed would be placed there to keep the “people of the asphalt” (to borrow a term from Brazil) feeling safe, and keep the homeless out of the central parts of the city. Police would essentially move the most impoverished away from urban centers, and a mix of the impoverished, downtrodden, and utopian creatives would create a civilization that the formal government would acknowledge but not intervene in unless it spilled out of the borders. Food would be grown in community gardens and bartering or local currencies (which also have a history in the US and are being used in some communities right now) would be standard.

I think this is the only possible conclusion to the unfettered capitalism as we are currently defining it. Without massive federal spending direct to the masses or a massive overhaul to what it means to have a living wage we are not going to have enough jobs or consumer demand to keep the economy going at the rates necessary for all to thrive. 

If I could come out in favor of a solution it would be a federal jobs guarantee, where the government essentially creates jobs based in coronavirus testing, infrastructure repair, caregiving, food bank management, healthcare, and more. This nationalization would solve more problems than a strict UBI, but it creates its own issues and is much more infrastructure to manage.

It is almost politically impossible to even talk about such feats in government spending until things get much worse, however, so I’m thinking we’re going to start seeing more uprisings and examples of the former before we see revolution in the latter.",9,1593233962.0

t3_i074tg,g03oxtr,"/u/homerj742 \-  I think others have already linked you to graphs that show the distribution of wealth & income in the United States. However, to quickly illustrate the distribution:  the ""top 1%"" are the Americans, who if stacked from poorest to wealthiest, make up the top one percent of the group.

Today the top 1% owns about 35% of America's household wealth, and earns about 25% of total income.

**Wealth:**  The net value of one's assets. i.e., the net total valuation of both liquid assets (cash, checking accounts, treasury bonds) and assets that are less so (stocks, physical property, intellectual property, etc.).

**Income:** What an individual earns in a year's time. This may be from wages, interest, rent, stock distributions & dividends, or capital gains on the sale of property.

Currently, the wealth gap is increasing in the United States. Each year the top 1% is taking a larger & larger share of both private wealth and income.

There isn't exactly a single reason why this is happening. A lot of this trend towards this inequality is a bit of a mystery. So, what I believe you can say instead, is that there are multiple factors that are working together to make this happen.

However here are a couple of reasons,

* **State & Federal Tax policies:**  The wealthiest tend to make money in different ways (stock dividends, rent, & inheritance typically) that the less wealthy (wages, salaries typically).  In recent decades the Federal & State governments have specifically reduced tax rates on the ways the wealthy make money — meaning they get keep a larger % of their earnings.
* **Decline of worker/employee power:**  Companies have become much better at reducing or holding salary expenses the same in the past decades. Since the less wealthy earn the majority of their income through wage & salary, it means their incomes are growing slower, or even regressing when accounting for inflation. This has come about from several factors,

&#x200B;

* First, labor unions representation are declining —  in years past a labor union could grind a company's production to a halt, if its workers weren't given fair cost of living wage increases.
* Second, companies are leveraging remote working (internet, VPNs, telecons) and cheap transportation to offshore work from the USA to cheaper cost-of-living areas like China, India, Malaysia, etc.
* Third, technology advances. Companies are getting better at eliminating the need for employee labor as newer technologies are able to stand-in for not just low-skill and repetitive tasks, but even ""middle management"" type roles.

&#x200B;

* **Eroding social support programs:**  In the USA, at least, government spending on public assistance programs that support low income individuals have been slowly eroding over the years:  food stamps, education, TANF, medicaid, etc.
* **Cultural:**  Since the 1980s, a Americans on the whole tend to accept the idea of economic inequality more. The idea that the ""wealthy are wealthy, and the poor are poor — and not much can change it.""",2,1596378663.0

t3_if5mxt,g2lntw6,"Not that I 100% agree with this, but to answer your question as I understand it, here goes.

The Fed has a limited set of tools when the economy is in free fall. Primarily, they can manage the interest rate and money supply. They can cut interest rates drastically and pump more money into the economy. However, that has a limited effectiveness when the free fall is really bad (like in 2008 and now with the pandemic). Rates can only go to zero and if the economy is too stuck, no amount of money can get it going.

There was a big debate in 2008 on whether to let companies fail. That would have been the laissez-faire method that certain conservative people cling to. However, over the last ~100 years, we've learned that letting the free market handle it ends up causing a much worse outcome than government intervention. That's why when they decided to bail out the banks, they gave money to all of them, including those not really in trouble. The consensus on this move is that it stabilized the economy and prevented the kind of job loss we saw in 1929.

Now, the problem isn't that the economy itself was in trouble but that people are being prevented from spending money in the economy due to the stay at home orders. No amount of pumping money into the economy will allow it to move around in a way that it normally does. The goal is to prevent a permanent economic impact if this is a temporary problem (i.e. a vaccine could get us back out again).

Why not bail out individuals? Great question. I think that Republicans think that it will incentive people to not work even if they can. That ignores the fact that we don't want them to work in a lot of situations in order to prevent the spread of COVID 19. Also, we would still need to bail out certain businesses (e.g. airlines because many people just can't fly right now). We wouldn't want to permanently lose those businesses (and corresponding jobs) if they went under right now.

Again, these are the economic arguments as I understand them. Hopefully helpful but please don't roast me for an honest attempt to answer your question.",47,1598201871.0
t3_if5mxt,g2my1sf,"There is economic theory and economic fact. There are these words like Socialism and Fascism thrown around but its a lot like the word Terrorism. Terrorism is not legally defined because basically every election season is a lesson in coercive domestic terrorism. Bush 43 changing the threat level while running for re-election is terrorism. Banks and corporations are parties to terrorism everyday. Free Market. Fair Market.

Its all just words. Means zero.

Here is what we have. We have several organized criminal enterprises operating in the United States. We have no government. That's window dressing. Congress, Presidency, and Supreme Court are all just tools of the 1%. Period.

America is on life support. Corruption is so deep its from top to bottom and bottom to top. I see it everyday. You see it everyday. My supervisor at work changed his brakes and oil while on the clock. Watched him take a refund for the brakes when he just needed to swap them. Takes lunch while out on an errand for the company. Higher ups in the company made a huge mistake that violated city code. So everytime inspectors come around we had to go temporarily change things just for the inspection. But the city tells us which ones they are inspecting. Where I used to work a woman complained about mold and got evicted. It was all over the place. Inspector came and looked at nothing because if they had they would have seen a 2 foot square hole in the cat walk that had been there for 2 years. Cops. Nuff said. Clerks not ringing up friends. People on their phones when they should be working. City councils manipulating neighborhood property values for corporate interests. Etc etc etc.

And its all about money mostly. 1% own 50% of the stock market and 20% own 80% of everything. They own Congress. 

So we can toss around labels and talk theory but there has never been a democratic America and if Organized Crime is the definition of capitalism then I guess we are capitalist.

t3_imd66o,g4081k5,"Great topic.  Things are definitely changing and the key to your question is reserve currency.  The USD has been the world's reserve currency since 1944 and that status has provided the US with an ""exorbitant privilege"".  Google that term for your essay.  The tides are shifting now and the privilege is being revoked.

What we are going to see is a currency paradigm shift. Global debt and currencies are going to get shaken up in a big way. The trend is moving towards central bank digital currencies.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/06/covid-cash-digital-currencies-coronavirus-central-banks https://www.weareworldquant.com/en/thought-leadership/central-bank-digital-currency-promises-and-risks/ https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/23/design-choices-for-central-bank-digital-currency/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/07/22/the-us-is-falling-behind-on-digital-dollar/#2d8c32b820e9

Basically central banks will print the current money to the point that it becomes worthless at the same time so does their debts in those currencies. Then they will unveil their respective new digital dollars that solve all the world's problems. This song and dance has happened many times in history but this is the first time that it has been truly global.  Great examples are the Weimer Hyperinflation (https://www.businessinsider.com/weimar-germany-hyperinflation-explained-2013-9) and the Dutch Florin's fall from world reserve status in the late 1700s (https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb16q4a2.pdf)

We will see a power struggle for the world's reserve currency. I don't think the greenback is going to win the day. Libra is a real contender and that freaks every government out.

China is leading the pack with its Digital Yuan (https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Comment/China-takes-battle-for-cryptocurrency-hegemony-to-new-stage, https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-digital-yuan-cbdc-is-close-but-many-details-remain-unknown).  The EU isn't too far behind (https://en.bankenverband.de/newsroom/comments/europe-answer-libra/).  The US and other countries are working hard on their own CBDCs.

Every government is afraid of the LIbra, backed by Facebook.  There are other contenders too.  

Going forward I don't think we'll ever see one government, or one entity reign over the world's economy.  We will see things distributed into regions where regional powers have control.  Those regions don't need to be geographical anymore.  We have global corporations today with a market cap that is higher than most countries.  

We are entering an economic reshuffling that has never been seen before.  There will be winners and losers and we will see the adoption of new digital currencies all over the world.

It’s not. The important thing to understand is as an app matures, “young users”:

1. Get bored.
2. Can’t get any attention because of everyone else.

So, they “focus more time” on TikTok, instead of Instagram and Snapchat. They roll to the “New App”. These users are an advertisers dream; they are suckers that will buy anything.

So in 5 years, we’ll probably have a new app that does the same thing that everyone is clamoring about.

The primary goal; gain as many “young” users as possible by scaling out without cost controls. Worry about making money later(Amazon Business Plan)

* Young users are between 10 - 35. 
* Once you are 40 and over, your considered old.

Then you:

* Introduce new features which attract young women, which attracts “all” men. This is what “sex sells”means.
* Introduce activities that make them do stupid things which keeps them using the platform.
* Add features to keep them on the platform.
* Introduce ads to monetize.
* Introduce ways to buy things.
* Build an advertising company within the parent company.
* Vacuum up every piece of data you can to help the “MadMen” sell more crap.
* Vacuum up data to create a knowledge base on your users.
* Vacuum up data to sell it.

TikTok is basically the new Snapchat. Snap stagnated. 

* Snap is “extreme shortform TV”. Your looking at live feeds of “TV stations of your friends”. This is TikTok’s claim to fame, but it’s not new. In addition TikTok plans of having an IPO next

Why is TikTok a national security threat?

* Because it is sucking up literally everything about what you are doing on and off the app. It’s gives the Chinese government insight into the “American Teenage” lifestyle.

* It’s not following “common data guidelines” other tech companies use, which has made them upset.

* Since 100 million American “young users” are on this platform, it’s an easy way to research and develop “mind control” techniques to affect these people once they are of voting age. Again, this has been done before; Facebook admitted to experimenting on user behavior.

Why is Oracle and Walmart getting into bed with the company?

* If TikTok goes public like Snapchat, both stand to make billions. TikTok will be popular for at least 5 -10 years.

* Oracle is behind in Cloud Computing. They probably forced TikTok to use OCI. And will use TikTok as an example to pad their sh___y OCI services. This “should attract more companies” to OCI, but it’s not happening. No one trusts or likes Oracle.

* Oracle makes its money on licensing and suing others because of it. They don’t really do anything.

* No one in the tech community likes Oracle(Java, DynDNS, MySQL, VirtualBox as examples), but they’ll work for them if offered a job. 

* Walmart wants to use TikTok to sell more crap from Walmart.com. They basically admitted that. This helps them take on Amazon. Walmart probably got a deal on advertisement through the app. Don’t worry, Walmart will die. It will take a while, but it will. They are on borrowed time already.

Why isn’t all Social Media banned or regulated? Or banned during important economic and political activities?

* No one knows. It should be at this point. At least regulate it to provide factual information. The ____ helps cause anxiety and depression.

* If people want to spread false junk, let them do it among themselves in a private chat room. No one wants to see Anti-Vax, Anti-Mask, Racism, Sexism, Murder, Rape, etc. in their daily RSS or news feed.

Why are US corporations and US politicians using their muscle in this situation?

* Because the US has a debt and “dollar as the reserve currency problem”. It’s amazing what you will do when you owe so much and can’t pay your bills to the bank(Federal Reserve).

* So, why not start using mob tactics to get a cut of revenue from overseas companies. Or force them to become an American company.",9,1600607649.0

Since we can’t live on my pay here - off we go. We move in 10 days and I’ve already found a job. So it depends market to market. I really only looked for a job in DC for about a month. For reference I finished my undergrad business degree a year ago. My wife has an MBA she just finished and another Masters of Experimental Psych. So, I don’t think she need to do grad school right away. Sometimes having a graduate degree with nothing behind is isn’t worth any more to a company than a BS. Also, my wife feels like she made a mistake going from undergrad straight to grad school without taking a break. She was advised to get a Masters if Psych instead of a PhD because she wanted to do research but not in an academic setting. She works for government contractors and having “only” a masters held back her career. Had she known she would need the PhD to advance up the career ladder she would have done that. This is why she went back for an MBA. It’s allowed her to lattice to a different career track within government contracting and research. Getting a second masters did nothing for her pay. So I would say in all practicality. Wait on the grad school.

At the end of 2008 and 2009, these smart money investors sold their treasury bonds at a profit. 

In 2009 and 2010, as the fed deployed QE, releasing tons of liquidity, the smart money bought stocks. These smart investors new three things. 1. Stocks were underpriced in 2009. 2. The massive amount of QE was going to drive stock prices higher. 3. The economy was recovering, and with it corporate earnings was recovering which would provide more support for stock prices.

So a strict quarantine of nursing homes and a not strict quarantine of other populations could have still achieved herd immunity, saved the economy and drastically reduced the death count. 

We also don't know the end of the story, in the US Sweden is getting beat the fuck up in our media because their death rates are higher than Denmark or Norway, but we haven't had the fall resurgence yet and we haven't seen the economic fall out yet. Norway and Denmark might end up with similar death rates if they have a big second wave and Sweden doesn't. If they end up with net the same numbers just over 9 months instead of 3 like...good job you got to the same place day late and dollar short.

What i think is going to happen is there will be class action lawsuit by all the landlords and because the class will be defined as anyone who owned rental and couldn't evict they can sue the state for damages, breech of contract, implicit seizure of property without compensation. There are going to be millions of plaintiffs and every law firm in the country will be jizzing in their pants to get that on consignment. Unlike a gym or a retail store, where it would be more difficult to suss out the damages, these are explicit contracts with monthly values. You miss three months rent, you know exactly how much money you lost.

In addition you are actually fucking over the people you are nominally trying to help. Their credit is completely fucked. They are going to have 9 months back payment and then a charge off, it will take decade to fix their credit scores. They better love the apartment they are not getting evicted from because the next one is going to be a shit hole. They better love their car cuz they are going to have it a while. 

Even if today, they stopped that moratorium, to be evicted in New York the sheriff's department needs to provide notice. They are going be fucking months behind, millions of units. It could take three months to get evicted after the moratorium is ended just because the police is so backed up. 

They are fucked and they have the audacity to lecture others.",2,1601745970.0

Ease your mind on the mask question, your government is doing the right thing. 

A Harvard Study published May 21, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine

""We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In  many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.""

CDC study on the use of personal protective face masks against viral influenza transmission found no significant protection against or reduction of viral transmission of influenza among infected and uninfected individuals.

We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility

Masks are to protect other people from the wearer, not the other way around.

Virus particles are smaller than masks pores, meaning that they penetrate the mask and the virus is not airborne, so all measures are pointless and only a false sense of security...

But its cool to see how many people fell for that “protect the others” narrative... you can be told whatever by the so “called” experts and would believe it.

A new study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health concludes that densely populated spaces aren’t actually linked to higher infection rates.

Even more confounding, the study’s analysis indicates that crowded, dense locations are associated with lower coronavirus death rates.

The below information discusses cloth / face masks for generalized use in public as a proposed means of preventing viral infection.

Please don't conflate this with filtration masks like N95 respirators and higher intended for use by medical professional in hospital or similar environment.


Cloth/surgical face masks overview:

Cloth masks designed to protect wounds, blood splatter etc. Not designed as respiratory protectors - no viral filtration - for context one requires an electron microscope to view viruses. A cloth mask trying to filter viral particles is the equivalent of a soccer net trying to filter sand. No fit or seal on the face Prevents regular filtration through the nose due to imposed new breathing habits when wearing a mask. https://omft.info/en/news-posts/nasal-breathing-as-a-defense-against-the-corona-virus/",2,1601740714.0

For example climate change: if you have ""god like"" creatures perhaps they have the mental capacity to assess the impact of their gas fillup in their car to the fullest and mitigate these effects apropriatly. I.e. by investing in a similar counter measure after each time they fill up their tank by planting a tree (overly simplified ofcourse). In this case no government interferance is needed... 

However if the society is more like ours I think we can all agree that not everyone has the mental capacity to assess and mitigate all effects. This results in a need of some kind of intervention on the free market to account for effects which are perhaps neglible in the individual transaction but important as a whole.

t3_k8dp18,geylqo0,"So you're talking about a couple of different things here. But let's straighten out our terms so we can have a common ground of understanding. 

Capitalism is an economic system, which means private individuals or corporations, through their capital, control the means of production. They sell their goods and services in a market. A contrasting system would be socialism, where the workers control the means of production. 

So democracy is where power resides with the people, and a republic is representative democracy. People elect officials to represent them on their behalf.

I believe, that you're highlighting the controversy between two systems of the U.S. (our capitalistic economic system and representative democratic system) where those who concentrate wealth in the economy, use that wealth to concentrate power/influence in our political system to create more wealth. Thus leading to income inequality and our government doing things that are not inline with public opinion. Please correct me if I've characterized your concerns incorrectly. 

Then you refer to evaluating government action, by ""asking who does it serve?"" To me, this refers to the legitimacy of the use of power. Which is something all humans should do. Just because you have power doesn't mean your actions are always legitimate.",3,1607362408.0

t3_kbezah,gfi1m8q,"Economically this makes perfect sense. The wealthy have amassed the majority of the capital, and with the current state of affairs their wealth is mostly invested in the stock market, rather than physical capital. The bubble instigated by congressional stimulus will collapse right as the large market holders scramble to secure their assets in the midst of this impending doom. The demise of productivity and middle class financial support will follow. To save the economical structure of mass productivity generating useful capital after the pop, another round of congressional aid must be given to the lower classes. 

However, the prospect of redistributing wealth through taxes is a precedent fervently admonished. This is in part due to the infiltration of capitalist sentiment amongst elected officials, as the ideology of wealth preservation is bipartisan. Politics, through misdirection of attention onto identity rather than financial policy, has solidified the status quo of corporate appeasement amongst all branches of government. 

They would rather print more money to salvage the broken economy than even attempt redistribution. However, this will have the inevitable effect of inflation. Just as years after the 2008 crash and subsequent influx of capital, prices have continually increased. In fact, some economists argue the full effect of the 2008 inflationary influence wasn't complete at the time of the current crises. The long term result of the current influx from the current and likely secondary stimulus, while holding such a low interest rate (meaning increased borrowing), will undoubtedly result in massive inflation.",2,1607759698.0

All of my other bills have been the same.

If you are concerned about inflation, then you should be targeting the politicians. McConnell for example put a martini lunch deduction in the recent bill. If the deficit is such a concern to them, then why include that????

Also the bill includes billions to other countries, including a Chinese program.
